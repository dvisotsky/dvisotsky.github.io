<p>It's been a minute.
Or like 2 months lol.</p>
<h2 id="red-ventures">Red Ventures</h2>
<p>Last couple entries I was unemployed, but last week I started at Red Ventures and am currently having a <em>good time</em>.
Darwin is a Sr. Engineer and has been helping me get onboarded, I've mostly been going through a Vue course on Udemy since that's the framework we're using, but today I switched to Node.js to learn backend since Vue is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I should backtrack a bit on how I landed here.
Spectrum Medical, Atypic, and Lowe's were other places I interviewed at.</p>
<p>Atypic was easy work but could only pay like 80k a year, I liked the company but yeah that wouldn't be optimal.</p>
<p>Spectrum Medical makes cool products - perfusion machines - and their software product would track data live as well as generate reports.
It had a similar vibe to Wastequip actually, it was in Fort Mill though and required 5 days in office for the first 6 months. And I didn't really see an opportunity for growth there.</p>
<p>Lowe's would have been really cool, with the location in South End and probably some good chances to grow in position. I fumbled the technical interview though - couldn't write a custom React Hook on the spot and forgot what Higher Order Components were. I knew that stuff but the terminology tripped me up and I was a bit nervous.</p>
<p>So here we are, at Red Ventures. Eddie Herbert actually referred me to the position and I'll be working on his team. We're building a product to connect people to insurance providers, it's called Coverage and Eddie thinks it could get pretty big.</p>
<p>I already mentioned Darwin, he's pretty cool. Married with a little girl and 2 dogs. He likes watching TV and restraurants.
Kristi is a Staff Engineer that's a little more reserved but she's cool too, she goes to jiu jitsu classes and used to be the Engineering Manager but stepped down not that long ago.
Nina is the Team Leader (I forget the actual title but she manages Jira and assigns work to people). She's from a marketing/business background and this is a new role for her, she seems stressed about it but according to Eddie the team is doing fine.</p>
<p>There are a lot more names and people but these are the first I've met and had the most interactions with in my first week.
This 2nd week has been very quiet - we get Thursday and Friday off for Independence Day and most of the team is out.
Hopefully next week I'll pick up tickets and get some actual work done.</p>
<p>I still stay in touch with Ben and Michael - actually it's mostly Michael that reaches out to me but I want to get coffee with them at Hex in the next couple weeks.
Probably not next Friday cuz I'm going to Nantahala for the weekend.</p>
<h2 id="bible-study">Bible Study</h2>
<p>Bible Study is tonight, I'm leading it on the 2nd part of [[John chapter 10]]. I think I'm getting better at leading them but it still feels clunky at times when I don't put in the proper prep time and have good discussion questions though. That's on me and my time management.
Inna and I talk kind of frequently about our roles at church, we don't really have friends our own age and are more of mentors to the youth I guess.
It doesn't bother me most of the time but several times in the past year (or few I guess) I've considered plugging into a community group at Vizion church in hopes of finding people our age.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>I bought like 5 games in the past couple weeks. Bullets Per Minute is my favorite so far, idk how much I'll play the others. But looks like I'm in the gaming tide, I expect after a month or few I'll get tired and focus more on coding or other stuff. Then again maybe Red Ventures will keep me learning fast enough that I won't need to outside of work.
I also just purchased a Ferris Sweep today and am excited to try out choc switches.
We went disc golfing a few times in the past few months and I'm itching to go again just to be outside and moving more.
I have a daily reminder to do 30 pushups but it's not enough to feel stagnant at the end of the day.
Been getting better at chess though, I think I'm at around 750 in Blitz.</p>
<h2 id="gather">Gather</h2>
<p>I'm on Nik's payroll to help build an app for conference but haven't touched it since I started the new job.
My goal there was to learn more backend but since were using Supabase it's mostly clicking around - I guess that requires knowledge of theory but it won't help me know any specific frameworks like Django or Node.js.
If I can balance RV and Gather there's a chance Gather could get big and I'd be a founder, but that's all speculation and a few years away at least probably.</p></div>
