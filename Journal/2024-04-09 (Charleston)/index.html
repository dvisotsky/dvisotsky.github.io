<p><a href="../">Back</a></p>
<p>This past weekend we went to Charleston with my family and Babushka.
Inna and I left on Friday later in the morning after my standup meeting and I finished work at a coffee shop once we got there (Second State) and then we met up with everyone else (except dad) in the city.</p>
<p>By this point I think everyone was a little tired from the trip and I was feeling kinda frustrated but we had a good time just walking around the city.</p>
<p>Towards evening Inna and I stopped by Mod Pizza to grab dinner for everyone and we headed back to the hotel. Inna and I shared a suite with Max and Natasha and Mom, Ivan, Polina, and Babushka had their own suite.</p>
<p>In the morning Mom and Polina woke up early and went for a 10k run over the bridge while Inna and I took Ivan and Babushka to Waffle House for breakfast with Max and Natasha.</p>
<p>Then we all met up in the city and got coffee at Idle Hands which was my favorite coffee spot of the trip. I just got an Americano (I've been having those a lot more recently lately) and it was was a very smooth and light taste.
The pour overs were also really good.</p>
<p>Then we did a bunch of Touristy walking around and towards late afternoon we went to the beach for some group photos.</p>
<p>Oh we also went to Fort Sumter which was cool, we got some funny photos there with the cannons. I also liked the photo of the watch tower with the nautical flags (I'm still not sure what they mean, we tried looking them up later)</p>
<p>At the beach there were a lot of sand fleas but we still got some nice photos, some passerby took one with me in it ( I was carrying the camera around for the trip to learn how to use it)</p>
<p>We got home pretty late, at around 9 I think, and made stir fry.
Everyone helped out and it turned out pretty good, we had a ton left over though.</p>
<p>On the last morning we went to Holey CIty bagels without Mom and Polina and Babushka since they woke up early and went for coffee even though we agreed on a time and place the night before. Ivan went with Inna and I and we stood in like for like 15 minutes (the line was out the door)</p>
<p>I don't really get the hype but it was nice to just spend the time and not worry about anything.</p>
<p>We met up with Mom's group after and went to Sightsee coffee which was also very good, they have a ginger beer tonic permanently on the menu which I'd forgotten about.</p>
<p>There were some cool photos there too that I liked, I had to go across the street to get far away enough to take the shot.</p>
<p>Max and Natasha left after coffee but the rest of us headed to Folly Beach for some sun.
Except it was cold and windy lol.
There were still a lot of people on the beach but I ended up putting on a hoodie and nobody swam.</p>
<p>Ivan did a sick flip there and I'm glad I got a photo of it because he landed on hard sand and bruised both of his heels. Now he walks on his toes.</p>
<p>Babushka left back home today but we visited parents last night to share photos with Padre and say bye to babushka.
Her flight should be taking off any minute now.</p></div>
