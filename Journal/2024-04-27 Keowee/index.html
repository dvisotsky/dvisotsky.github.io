<p><a href="../">Back</a></p>
<p>I'm at Lake Keowee, we drove up after Awana yesterday and boy what a day we've had. 
It started off great - I felt very rested sleeping in a hammock and the weather was perfect in the morning. 
I brought our new camera (Olympus OM-D EM5 Mark III) and was still getting familiar with it during our hike after breakfast. 
I like it but it has limitations when it comes to low light. I'm hoping the lens I ordered yesterday will help with that. 
But since it's obviously pretty bright during the day outside I think I got some good shots.  </p>
<p>Anyways about halfway through the hike I realized I didn't have the car keys with me, I'd left them in the car.
I also left my wallet and we had the MacBook, iPad, and a bunch of other stuff in the car. </p>
<p>I thought to myself that hikers are generally kind people and hopes for the best. 
I couldn't shake the nervousness, but decided to not tell Inna so she wouldn't worry. 
I figured if something were to happen I wouldn't be able to make it back in time anyway. </p>
<p>We hiked for like 2 hours I think, and when we got back to the car I was relieved to see that it was still where I left it, and the keys, wallet, iPad, and MacBook were still there. </p>
<p>We had offered to make lunch and I'd cooked some chicken and veggies the day before for burritos so when we got back to the campsite I began slicing tomatoes for toppings. 
The knife was kinda dull and I remembered that id brought the folding knife that Misha had gifted me a few years ago.
I went to grab it from the car but couldn't find the backpack where I'd put it. 
I asked Inna if she'd seen it and then realized that it could've gotten stolen. 
We searched for a bit and I noticed that the new camera bag we'd bought was also not in the car. 
Hoping they'd turn up we decided to change and go paddle boarding. </p>
<p>But our suitcase was also not in the car. </p>
<p>That's when called the police. 
We were missing the suitcase with all our clothes for the weekend, both toiletries bags, Inna's makeup, my backpack, and the camera bag. </p>
<p>I reported a theft and they said they'd send out a deputy to get a report going. While we waited for someone to arrive Valera and Natasha drove to where we hiked to see if they could find anything. </p>
<p>Things felt pretty bleak and I considered just going home. </p>
<p>It'd been probably an hour since we realized we'd been robbed, I felt heavy in my gut even though all that stuff was replaceable. 
It just put a cloud over the trip. </p>
<p>Then Natasha sent a Snapchat showing that they found the camera bag and make-up!</p>
<p>That alone was enough to raise my spirits and I was so thankful. </p>
<p>They finally returned and pulled out the suitcase from their car too!
They'd found everything except Inna's toiletries bags with her toothbrush and deodorant. </p>
<p>5 mins after Officer Campbell pulled into the campsite. 
We explained the situation and he asked if anything was missing. 
We talked and ended up chatting a bit, he was very talkative. </p>
<p>I ended up not filing a police report - we got all the bags back and the only things missing were a camera Lens that I was going to return, my Gameboy emulator, and my Sony earbuds. 
All in all less than $500 so not worth an insurance claim and that stuff didn't really have a chance of being found. </p>
<p>We ended up going back with Natasha and Valera to where the found our stuff on the side of the road and found a random schoolgirl's backpack and Inna's toothbrush bag. </p>
<p>Everything was ok. </p>
<p>I still feel guilty for leaving the keys but Inna was very understanding and supportive. I've still got the keys in my pocket now, I don't think I'll ever leave them in the car like that again. </p>
<p>After all that we still went paddle boarding for a while and then had shashlik for dinner at like 10. </p>
<p>God is good, this could've been a lot worse but I'm not even mad about the stuff we did lose. </p>
<p>It showed me how I didn't fully rely on God through this trial. 
I'd prayed for our stuff to be not stolen when I realized that I'd forgotten the keys but when I found out it did I never stopped to pray about what would happen next.
I just kind of resigned to the fact that we'd have to buy new stuff. 
Which isn't totally bad - I was ready to let those things go but I think I should seek first what Gods plan is in all this instead of just "oh well, guess that's that." </p>
<p>Tomorrow we want to go paddle boarding again and hit Greenville on the way home for some Indian Food. </p></div>
