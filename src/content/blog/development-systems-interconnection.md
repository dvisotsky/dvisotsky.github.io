## Closing the Gap

Ask a carpenter or framer about their preferred tools for the job and you'll hear about different brands and tools that all have the goal of cutting and combining pieces of wood in different ways.
Ask a photographer about their worfklow and you'll hear about the pros and cons of different focal lengths, aperture settings, and editing software-- all for the end result of capturing a moment.

Every professional has their toolkit and workflow to achieve the best result they can. I've even heard that there is more than one way to skin a cat, however that's one skillset I'd rather not know the details of.

As a software engineer, I've also been dialing in my preferred methods of building software.
Thankfully, switching tools in my field is much easier than those that use hardware. In most cases I can simply install a new tool, or build it myself, instead of swapping entire battery ecosystems for power tools or camera brands for lens compatibility. The investment cost is lighter, and it encourages me to try different things out of curiosity.

The end goal is to close the gap between the idea dreamt up in my head and the experience that users have when they use the final product. The idea has a few layers to travel through before it makes it to the end user, and I'll discuss these in sequential order.

## Layer 1: Keyboard

The first layer is the computer keyboard. It's the only physical medium I'll be covering here, as it's had one of the biggest impacts in my workflow. Any thought or question I have must be inputted as text into the computer, and this requires the idea to travel through my fingers into the keyboard, which in turn passes the collection of scan codes into the system. Perhaps this interface will change in coming years as AI and speech-to-text systems continue to improve, but as of writing this article it remains the best way to transfer my ideas into the computer.

My delve into custom keyboards began with the desire to feel more comfortable switches and see better looking keycaps. Comfort while typing is a tangible improvement, and aesthetics serve to put the mind at ease while working. Out of the two, comfort is far more important in my opinion, and so my keyboard journey took me across a variety of form-factors. I've tried 60% keyboards, then wandered down to the 40% space, then down to 35% where I find myself typing now. Contesting the validity of such a small form factor deserves its own article, but for now I will defend it by recalling the importance of comfort. I've found that a keyboard where all keys can be reached without moving my fingers off the home row helps me stay dialed in. Furthermore, custom keyboards enable me to define a key map that caters to my preferences. Each key now has 2 or three functions, spanning from the base function of inputting a character, to text navigation, media control, and macros. While there is a learning curve associated with such customization, I get to decide how steep it is and how far I want to stray from conventional keyboard layouts. Currently I still use QWERTY instead of a more optimized layout like Colemak, mostly due to having settled into Vim keybinds and having no desire to juggle two layouts when switching from a custom layout to the standard that most of the world uses. For more content on why someone would willingly remove keys from their keyboard, check out the [40s wiki](https://40s.wiki/en/why). If you're especially curious and are thinking of expanding your horizons, I recommend the Planck or Minivan, either one can ease you into 40% keyboards without being incredibly jarring.
