<p><em>Samaritan woman at Jacob's well</em></p>
<h1 id="part-i-verses-1-17">Part I (verses 1-17)</h1>
<p><em>Main points</em>
- Jesus did not come to save just Israel, but the broken and ostracized
- If we know Jesus, we have the spring of living water </p>
<p><strong>Read Verses 1-6</strong></p>
<h2 id="jesus-travels-through-samaria">Jesus travels <em>through</em> Samaria</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Q:</em> Why did Jesus have to travel in the first place?<ul>
<li>The Pharisees were growing angry with Jesus making disciples</li>
<li><em>A:</em> He was avoiding a confrontation with the Pharisees, He knew it was not time yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Q:</em> Why did Jesus choose to travel through Samaria?<ul>
<li>Samaritans were half-breed Israelites. During the Assyrian rule, all but the lowest class Israelites were exiled from Samaria. Those left blended their families and culture with Gentiles of the region.</li>
<li><em>A:</em> Jesus wasn't racist. He came to save the broken, Samaritans were the target audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="they-come-to-jacobs-well">They come to Jacob's well</h2>
<ul>
<li>The well offers a a chance to rest, even though it was only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_hour">6th hour</a> of the day (noon).</li>
<li>This is relatable to us, we have all felt tired and hot and in need of cold water.</li>
<li><em>Q:</em> Why do you think Jesus stayed outside the city?<ul>
<li>Because He didn't want to deal with Samaritans?</li>
<li>Why not just go and do a miracle in the market? They would all believe probably.</li>
<li>Too tired?</li>
<li>He knew the woman was coming</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read verses 7-15</strong></p>
<h2 id="jesus-meets-the-samaritan-woman">Jesus meets the Samaritan woman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Typically, even to this day, women travel together, yet she is here alone, in the heat of the day, to draw water.</li>
<li><em>Q:</em> Why was she here now, and why was she alone?<ul>
<li>Even among Samaritans, she is on the fringes of society</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Q:</em> Why would Jesus want to talk to her? The fact that she's alone and coming at a weird time are red flags<ul>
<li>the woman is questioning his actions</li>
<li>risk gossip, impurity, temptation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus doesn't care about your nationality, your mistakes, your place in society. He is here to bring heaven to earth and that means breaking down cultural boundaries that are meant to put some people above others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jesus-and-the-woman-talk-about-water"><strong>Jesus and the woman talk about water</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>"Living Water" could also refer to moving water, water that has less bacteria because it is not stagnant</li>
<li>Jesus: "If you knew who I was, you'd be asking me for water"<ul>
<li>He is making her curious about who he is and what he has to offer</li>
<li>If you knew Jesus better, you would want more what he has to offer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” 
 <em>John 4:14</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Q:</em> What does he mean by "a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life"?<ul>
<li><em>A:</em> you will be able to provide for others yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"What if I feel like my spring has dried up? I used to have it but I don't feel the same anymore"
- Drink again, go to the source, reconnect</p>
<h2 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought</h2>
<p>Are we aware of our brokenness and searching for healing?
How do we decide who is worthy of our love?
Do we exclude people in our lives because of the mistakes that they've made?</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take a minute to note who in your life seems like the Samaritan Woman. Give them a nickname if you're afraid of people peeking at your notes.<ul>
<li>Pray for them this week, and talk to them if you're not a chicken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you feel like you don't have the spring of living water that Jesus is talking about, write down why you think that is and what you could do to fix it. </li>
<li>If you think you already have the living water, write down what you've been doing with it and who you've been giving it to.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="part-ii-verses-18-54">Part II (verses 18-54)</h1>
<p>Quick Recap:
- Jesus was traveling through Samaria and met a woman at a well
- He didn't care that she was a Samaritan, a woman, or that she was alone
- Jesus looks past our mistakes and misfortunes, and we should do the same
- Jesus offers <em>living water</em> that will bubble up form us if we have a strong relationship with Him</p>
<p><strong>Read verses: 16-26</strong></p>
<h2 id="i-who-speak-to-you-am-he">"I who speak to you am He"</h2>
<p>They have been talking for a little bit and it would be more proper if her husband was present. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”  The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”
<em>- John 4:16-18</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a little savage to call someone out like that - <em>YOu ARE RIGht In sAyinG "i hAVE no hUsBand"</em> - like you're poking fun at their failures.</p>
<p><em>Q:</em> Why would Jesus do that?
- <em>A:</em> Jesus' goal here is not just to jeer at the woman, he wants her to confront her past. In order to to obtain living water, the junk blocking your spring must be cleaned out.</p>
<p><em>Q:</em> Were her failed marriages her fault?
- <em>A:</em> we don't know, and it doesn't matter
- We have a tendency to avoid 'damaged' people even if we don't know the full story</p>
<p><em>Q:</em> Why does the woman respond with a question about worship? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sir, I perceive you are prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."
- When you bring home a speeding ticket and your parents ask how your day was, would you rather bring up your ticket or literally anything else?
- Like the chisel skit, it's scary to let someone else chip away parts of you, but in the end it is better.
- <em>A:</em> to avoid the question, to skirt confronting her mistakes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus rolls with it, and tells her that soon it won't matter and no one will debate where worship should happen.
He also <em>reveals who he is</em>, he didn't do that for anyone else. Not at the wedding, not to the Pharisees, but to this woman who is not accepted by anyone.
Why? Because she is ready for His kingdom</p>
<p><strong>Read verses 27-38</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-fields-are-white-for-harvest">The fields are white for harvest</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
- John 4:38</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Group Q</em>: with those around you, come up with 5 names of people who sowed the field before you came into the picture.
- John the Baptist
- Moses
- King David
- D. Pasha
- Chris Tomlin</p>
<p>We are a small part of a much bigger story, nonetheless, we must decide what side of the story we want to be on.</p>
<p><strong>Read verses 39-45</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-samaritans-believe">The Samaritans believe</h2>
<p>The woman herself became a sower that went before the disciples
- The Samaritans came to believe because of what they themselves had seen, not because of what the woman had told them
    - Just so, our faith must depend on our own experience with Jesus and not just what we hear from other people.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I was asked at Cafe about when my faith became my own, I shared my testimony about how I came to believe in Jesus based on my own experience instead of the experiences of my family and friends.</p>
<p><em>Group Q:</em> One or two people from your group, share about when your faith became your own instead of someone else's.</p>
<p>Your faith will grow to stand on its own, no matter what you do.
Where you put your faith depends on you.
It could be in knowledge, wealth, relationships, etc.
But when your life is over it won't be those things that determine your eternity.
Will you be ready to meet Jesus on another level or is thinking about that time something you avoid?</p></div>
