<h2 id="the-adulterous-woman">The Adulterous Woman</h2>
<p><em>verses 1-11</em>
The Pharisees wanted Jesus to either break the law, or seem like a cruel man.
Adultery was rarely prosecuted because of the 2 witness requirement.
This woman appeared to be set up.</p>
<p>The man was not brought to face judgement.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-the-light-of-the-world">"I am the light of the world"</h2>
<p><em>verses 12 - 30</em></p>
<p><em>verses 12- 13</em>
<strong>Jesus makes his claim</strong>
"...as I was saying" - the adulterous woman was brought in while Jesus was teaching in the temple. Now we return to the scheduled program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am the light of the world. He who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life." - John 8:12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very well known verse, but entertain me and tell me what it means, what are the implications?
Explain it to me as if I am not a Christian.</p>
<p>The earth rotates at about 1000 miles per hour. 
How fast can a jet fly?</p>
<p>If we had a jet that could fly that fast and refuel in mid-air, we could perpetually stay on the sunny side of the earth and have never-ending days.</p>
<p>Jesus says if you stay with me, you will always be on the sonny side.</p>
<p><em>verses 14 - 18</em>
<strong>The pharisees attempt to dislodge it</strong>
"Who are you for me?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true" - John 8:13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about this as we read the next part:
Why does Jesus use himself as a witness? How is that a justifiable defense?
- "I know where I come from and where I am going"
- "I judge no one"</p>
<p>His identity was firmly rooted in what he believed in and knew.</p>
<p><em>verses 19 - 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where is your father"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was an insult, they were questioning the circumstances of Jesus' birth.
Lineage was of great importance, questioning a man's paternity was to insult the man's legitimacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one arrested him</p>
</blockquote>
<p>classic plot armor - it was not yet his time.</p>
<p><em>verses 21 - 28</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Will He kill Himself, because He says, 'Where I go you cannot come'?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another insult - the lowest levels of Hades were for those who committed suicide.</p>
<p>Jesus leaves the Pharisees with a haunting prophecy - when you lift me up, you will realize you are wrong.</p>
<p>In the end Jesus' actions and the way he was rooted in His identity led people to believe in him. He was able to hold His ground because He knew the truth.</p>
<p>He passed all the tests of the Pharisees with colors flying.</p>
<h2 id="the-truth-will-set-you-free">The truth will set you free</h2>
<p><em>verses 31 - 38</em>
Who is this statement directed at?
- The Jews who had just begun believing. He is telling them what they need to do to continue in belief.</p>
<p>Define 'Abide' - live, dwell, accept or act in accordance with
- make yourself at home</p>
<p>"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
"We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone."
- The Pharisees don't see Jesus' meaning, probably because of their individual pride.
- Tell me about the era that these Pharisees lived in.
- Jesus' statements sounds like a fortune cookie, can you tell me what this practically means?</p>
<p>"Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin"
- someone who habitually commits the same sin. It is your master and you have no control
- What is Jesus talking about regarding the son vs the slave remaining forever?</p>
<p>The slave has no inheritance in the house. He may be sold or dismissed without earning anything. Sin is that kind of master, it takes and gives nothing back.
Jesus offers a freedom where we become sons and daughters to an inheritance greater than we can perceive as mortal people.</p>
<p>Take a minute now and think about what holds your thoughts and actions hostage.
What habit are you struggling with and why are you holding onto it as if it satisfies you?</p>
<h2 id="you-are-of-your-father-the-devil">You are of your father the Devil</h2>
<p><em>verses 39 - 47</em>
The Pharisees are fully defensive here, they are not open to communicating or debating any longer.
"We are not born of sexual immorality" - why is this a stinger?</p>
<p>"You cannot bear to hear my word" - what makes them so stubborn?</p>
<p>What areas in your life do you protect from Jesus? 
What do you want Him to leave alone and ignore?</p>
<p>"This isn't that bad, my friends are into it, it's so common at school and work and on the internet and I don't even do it that much"</p>
<h2 id="before-abraham-was-i-am">Before Abraham was, I am</h2>
<p><em>verses 48 - 59</em></p>
<p>Jesus' position is upholding His Father's wishes.
The Pharisees are slinging mud. They seek their own glory.</p>
<p>"If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing" - tooting your own horn is frowned upon and makes you look needy.</p>
<p>"How do you determine your value as a person?"
How do you know you're a good, funny, pretty, athletic, valuable?</p>
<p>The value of a person is determined externally.
People value others based on their own perspective on life.</p></div>
