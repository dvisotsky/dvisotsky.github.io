<p><em>Verses 16-47</em></p>
<p><em>Recap verses 1-15</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is in Jerusalem, at the Pool of Bethesda</li>
<li>He heals a paralyzed man on the Sabbath</li>
<li>The pharisees get upset</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="receiving-rebukes">Receiving Rebukes</h2>
<h3 id="john-516-18">John 5:16-18</h3>
<p>Another exchange between Jesus and the Pharisees.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why were the Pharisees so upset at what seemed like a good thing?
<strong>A:</strong> It goes deeper than "it's against the Sabbath." This is their way of life put into question.</p>
<p>What is the worst genre of music?
What if Jesus came back, today, just to tell us that Country is the genre of worship that is his favorite and henceforth all of our songs should be country?
Repulsive - get rid of him</p>
<p>Music is just one example of things that we can get caught up with that seem like a battle worth fighting but is actually nonsense.
The goal is to make heaven on earth, the details only matter if it's to help those who don't yet know God relate to Him better.
Language, clothing, money, education, it's only good if it brings glory to God.</p>
<p><em>John 5:17</em>
<strong>Q:</strong> Why does Jesus reply with "My Father is working until now, and I am working" - what does work have to do with healing someone?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Jesus was 'working' on the Sabbath and told the newly healed man to 'work' by taking up his bed and walking.
Jesus says "My Father is working until now" - God the Father works even until the Sabbath.
he is a working God - not just someone who commands and oversees, but steps in Himself.
The Sabbath was ordained for man's benefit, not because God needed rest.</p>
<p><em>John 5:18</em>
This is the first time that John mentions the Pharisees wanting to kill Jesus, because he broke the Sabbath and told other to do it too, and because he claimed to be the Son of God.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-defends-his-mission">Jesus defends his mission</h2>
<h3 id="john-519-29">John 5:19-29</h3>
<p>Jesus now goes into a monologue defending his actions and explaining his purpose here on Earth</p>
<p>Jesus bring this up as a comparison to how God interacted with Israel up until now.
<strong>Q:</strong> Before Jesus, how did God speak to His people?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Through prophets. They would hear from God and pass His laws, desires, and command to Israel.</p>
<p>But now, Jesus take the place of the Prophet. We no longer have someone between us and God, because Jesus <em>is</em> God.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>John 5:25</em> What is Jesus talking about when he says the 'dead will hear the voice of the Son of God?'
<strong>A:</strong> Not literally dead, but spiritually.</p>
<p>In verses 24 and 25, Jesus firmly claims to be the key to eternal life. This man that looked and spoke and smelled like any other man claimed to be one with God.</p>
<p><strong>small group Q:</strong> <em>John 5:29</em> says the dead will have resurrection and 'those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.' <em>Does this mean that salvation is based on the good works we've done? If not, what is Jesus saying?</em>
<strong>A:</strong> Your works are an <em>indicator</em> of your faith, by your works we can tell what kind of person you are.
It's not about your career, but how you treat the people around you and the amount of respect you have for God and His word.</p>
<h3 id="john-530-47">John 5:30-47</h3>
<p>The scene is explained as if there is a <em>court trial</em> going on, Jesus claimed to be the judge of men and is now defending that claim.
Jesus knows the Law, He is referencing Deuteronomy 19:15:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed. Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>small group Q:</strong> Who are the 5 pieces of evidence Jesus mentions?</p>
<ol>
<li>John the Baptist</li>
<li>The 'shining light' that prepared the way for Jesus</li>
<li>But maybe he was just a weird guy in the desert - he did eat locusts after all</li>
<li>The miracles of Jesus</li>
<li>These point to Jesus being supernatural</li>
<li>But isn't the Messiah supposed to free us from Rome? Why are these 'miracles' about saving the sick, they probably did something against God and He's punishing them.</li>
<li>The testimony of God the Father</li>
<li>"And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased." - Luke 3:22</li>
<li>But you have neither heard His voice or seen His form</li>
<li>The Scriptures</li>
<li>Prophesy and speak of the coming of Jesus.</li>
<li>But the Pharisees saw the Word as the goal instead of a guide.</li>
<li>Moses</li>
<li>"If you believed in Moses, you would believe in me" - John 5:46</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all this, we know that the Pharisees will cling to their beliefs and refuse to accept Jesus as God and the savior of mankind.</p>
<p><strong>small group Q:</strong> Why are the Pharisees so stubborn? Can't they see that Jesus is trying to help them?
<strong>A:</strong> Look to yourself for the answer. We can relate to the Pharisees - we have our own reputation and pride to look after.</p>
<p>Their whole issue is that they shaped God into what they thought He should be like, instead of letting God change them into something more pure.</p>
<p>In groups of 2-3, talk about what you think inhibits you, personally, from hearing what God wants and acting on His plans for you.</p>
<p>Have a good week</p></div>
