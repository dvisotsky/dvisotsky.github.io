<h1 id="session-1">Session 1</h1>
<p><strong>Context</strong>
What happened last time?
    Jesus healed a blind man.
    The pharisees did not like that.
What's the overarching theme?
    Who is Jesus? Is He God or a crazy man?</p>
<h2 id="the-good-shepherd">The Good Shepherd</h2>
<p><em>verses 1 - 6</em>
<em>Q: Why do you think Jesus is using the analogy of a Shepherd specifically? (Why not a general or builder or farmer?)</em>
- A shepherd knows his sheep, by name.
- Sheep know their shepherd by his voice.
- The shepherd's goal is the safety and well-being of the herd.
- A shepherd was also a common analogy for a <em>king</em>- which is quite different form how we think of important people today.
  - <em>Q: How many of you have seen an important leader like a CEO or President?</em>
  - In this analogy, the king knows his people personally and his goal is to protect them, not gain power or money. The relationship pictured here is much more intimate.</p>
<p><em>Q: What does it mean to "climb up some other way?" (verse 1)</em>
- we have this image of a "gate" or proper way of entry, so what does it mean to come into the sheep the wrong way?
- <em>A:</em> The intention. The gate is for the shepherd who cares for the sheep, but thieves are there for personal gain. You can determine which one you are by what you think about while you're at church - is it the people and how you can connect with them or is it how you can put yourself on a good volleyball team or feel good about yourself by talking about other people behind their back?
- We have no sheep to steal at FSBC, but we have youth and newcomers who can tell if someone is genuine and cares about them or if they're just here to have fun, eat free food, gossip, and play volleyball.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. (ESV) - John 10:4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see that the shepherd doesn't use a stick or a border collie to get the sheep to obey him. The herd understands that the shepherd has their best interest in mind and will follow him wherever he leads.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of 1 - 6</strong>
- Jesus is the shepherd
- He knows his sheep individually
- His intention is to keep the sheep safe and care for them
- The sheep respond to his voice
- He does not drive his sheep but leads them - and they follow him</p>
<h2 id="i-am-the-door">I am the door</h2>
<p><em>verses 7 - 15</em>
"I am the door of the sheep"
    I thought Jesus was the shepherd, what's this now?
    Also, why does He compare Himself to a door?</p>
<p>This is still the same analogy - the shepherd <em>was</em> the door.
He would lay down across the entrance to the sheep pen at night to keep the sheep in and predators out.
His life is on the line for the sake of his sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. (ESV)
- John 10:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Q: Who is the thief?</em>
Anyone who's purpose is selfish and not for the benefit of God's people - or all people.</p>
<p><em>Q: What is the thief trying to steal, kill, and destroy?</em>
Some may say the thief is only trying to help the sheep have a good time while the shepherd has them locked up in the pen.</p>
<p><em>Q: What does it mean to have "life abundantly"?</em>
- Abundant life isn’t an especially long life.
- Abundant life isn’t an easy, comfortable life.
- Abundant life is a life of satisfaction and contentment in Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life is a matter of degrees. Some have life, but it flickers like a dying candle, and is indistinct as the fire in the smoking flax; others are full of life, and are bright and vehement.” (Spurgeon)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this comes the question: <em>Is your life abundant, and if not, what is missing?</em>
Like verse 14 says, "I know my own and my own know me"</p>
<p>Jesus wants you to trust Him, and He proved long ago that He doesn't care about the mistakes that you've made.
Jesus wants to give you life, and life abundant, but you have to trust Him as the shepherd and decide if He is your leader or if you're still down to get stolen from the flock and eaten by thieves or wolves.</p>
<h1 id="session-2">Session 2</h1>
<p><em>verses 16 - 42</em></p>
<h2 id="the-other-sheep">The other Sheep</h2>
<p><em>verses 16 - 21</em></p>
<h3 id="who-are-the-sheep-that-are-not-of-jesus-fold">Who are the sheep that are not of Jesus' fold?</h3>
<p><em>verse 16 - 18</em>
A: Gentiles, Jews are the original people of God, but Jesus is here to claim all of us.
- That means it is Jesus that unites us, He is our leader. Not culture or language, hobbies or careers, but our shepherd.</p>
<h3 id="therefore-my-father-loves-me-what-does-god-value-based-on-this-statement">"Therefore my Father loves Me" - what does God value based on this statement?</h3>
<p>A: Self sacrifice for the good of others.
- God is love, and love is caring and wishing the best for others.
- We do not choose whether we should die or not, we are not immortal. But Jesus chose to give up His life for us.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-is-a-madman-or-the-son-of-god">Jesus is a madman or the Son of God</h2>
<p><em>verses 19 - 21</em>
The people are split, and there really are only two options:
1. Jesus is crazy.
2. Jesus is everything He says he is.</p>
<h2 id="i-and-the-father-are-one">"I and the Father are One"</h2>
<p><em>verses 22 - 30</em></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. John 10:22</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also known as Hanukkah, the Feast of Dedication celebrated the cleansing and re-dedication of the temple after three years of desecration by Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria.
Antiochus had attacked Jerusalem, stolen from the temple, killed thousands of Jews and outlawed Jewish practices.
The Maccabees were a family that led a revolt against the king and used guerrilla warfare to take on the better equipped Syrians. They were able to recapture Jerusalem and take back the temple.</p>
<p>This is important because a lot of people expected Jesus to be like Judah the Maccabee.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong> 
The pharisees find Jesus as he was walking, and encircle Him to finally get a straight answer.</p>
<h3 id="q-what-does-it-seem-like-the-goal-of-the-pharisees-is-here">Q: What does it seem like the goal of the Pharisees is here?</h3>
<p>To get some political answer and pit Jesus against the Roman government.</p>
<h3 id="q-has-jesus-been-clear-about-who-he-is-up-to-this-point">Q: Has Jesus been clear about who he is up to this point?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am the one who came from heaven (John 3:13, 6:38).</li>
<li>Whoever believes on Me has eternal life (John 3:15).</li>
<li>I am the unique Son of God (John 5:19-23).</li>
<li>I will judge all humanity (John 5:19-23).</li>
<li>all should honor Me just as the honor God the Father (John 5:19-23).</li>
<li>the Hebrew Scriptures all speak of Me (John 5:39).</li>
<li>I perfectly reveal God the Father (John 7:28-29).</li>
<li>I always please God and never sin (John 8:29, 8:46).</li>
<li>I am uniquely sent from God (John 8:42).</li>
<li>before Abraham was, I Am (John 8:58).</li>
<li>I am the Son of Man, prophesied by Daniel (John 9:37).</li>
<li>I will raise Myself from the dead (John 10:17-18).</li>
<li>I am the Bread of Life (John 6:48).</li>
<li>I am the Light of the World (John 8:12).</li>
<li>I am the Door (John 10:9).</li>
<li>I am the Good Shepherd (John 10:11).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-what-is-jesus-reasoning-for-why-they-dont-believe-in-him">Q: What is Jesus' reasoning for why they don't believe in Him?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are not my sheep. You do not follow me.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-so-what-does-it-mean-to-be-jesus-sheep-practically">Q: So what does it mean to be Jesus' sheep, practically?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being aware of how you impact other people.<ul>
<li>Do the things I say make people feel better or worse?</li>
<li>When I'm done interacting with a person or group, how do they feel about me? Do they trust me?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validating your actions against what God would want from you, not what you want of yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Sheep</strong>
- have eternal life.
- will never perish.
- no one will take them from my hand.</p>
<p>Jesus cares for those who seek him and desire His leadership. If you want Jesus to lead you, He will never let you down.</p>
<h2 id="stones-against-him">Stones against Him</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"For which of my good works are you going to stone me?"
"Not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it not written in your Law, "I said, you are gods?"
(Psalm 82, Exodus 21:6, Exodus 22:8-9)</p>
<p>This is not just a "Destroyed with Facts and Logic" response, but calls out an idea from the Old Testament that God and Man are meant to be intertwined and connected.</p>
<p>The Old Testament judges were the people who God shared His word with, now the word is here, in the flesh.</p>
<p>Jesus holds no hostility against them, instead He once more encourages to try to understand Him and judge Him based on his actions.</p>
<h2 id="across-the-jordan">Across the Jordan</h2>
<p>Jesus leaves Jerusalem to lower his wanted level.</p>
<p>John did no miracles, but everything he said of Jesus was true. We should be like John and point people in the direction of Jesus.
With our actions and our character.</p></div>
