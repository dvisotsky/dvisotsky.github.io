[Back](./index.md)

You will be creating your own Bible Study today on one of these historical figures:

- Samson
- Ruth
- Gideon

Your Bible Study should cover the following objectives:

- Who is this person?
  - Give us some contextual info, history, accomplishments
- What challenges did they face?
  - How did they succeed or fail?
- What impact have they made on the modern world?
- What can I learn from this person?

It might be easier to split your group by objective,
So each person covers one of these objectives.

The presentation is up to you, but I encourage multiple people to speak because one person will not know all of the objectives.

## Samson

**Who:**
Nazarene
Cannot haircut
Has to be clean
**What:**
temptation struggles
powerful hair
betrayed by wife
**Why:**
follow God... or else

## Ruth

**Who:**
Moabite (pagan)
**What:**
husband dies
brother died
Stuck with mother in law
**Why:**
She chose God over her country and God rewarded her for it

## Gideon

**Who:**
House of Mannassah (house in Israel, weakest house)
smallest in house
Follows Baal and Asherah
First generation believer
**What:**
Mideanites were oppressing Mannassah
Gideon was feeling insecure
Gideon faced the Mideanites
It was like the 300 spartans
**Why:**
God can use anyone, even the least of the family
God showed his power in unexpected ways
God has a plan and just need willing participants

Ideas:
split into groups and go over the verses/chapter
