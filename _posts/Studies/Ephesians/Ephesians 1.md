# Context

Who wrote Ephesians? 
- *Paul*
When was Ephesians written? 
- *62 AD, while Paul was under house arrest in Rome.*
Why was Ephesians written?
- *Nothing against Ephesus, more to explain some of the great themes and doctrines of Christianity.* 
- *Some manuscripts have a blank space instead of "Ephesus." Perhaps this letter was intended to circulate among the early churches.*

Paul had spent 3 years in Ephesus, the people there were familiar to him.
One of the places where Paul took early Christians to a place other than the synagogue to learn more about the Way. (Acts 19)

Paul also indirectly caused a riot there (also Acts 19)


# Part 1: Spiritual Blessings in Christ
*verses 3 - 14*

## Blessed
*verse 3*
> Praise be to God who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

Material blessings are great, and we have an abundance of those as well. However as David Guzik says, "A new heart is better than a new coat."

## Chosen
*verse 4*
> For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.

**Q: Does God determine your destiny?**
With your group, find other places in the Bible where God chooses a specific purpose for people.
No repetitions allowed, so try to find more uncommon instances.

We see that there are many times where God decides what a person should be doing. Is that fair?

*Isaiah 4:59* (ESV)
> “Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker,  
    those who are nothing but potsherds  
    among the potsherds on the ground. 
    Does the clay say to the potter,  
    ‘What are you making?’ 
    Does your work say,  
   ‘The potter has no hands’?

That being said, did anyone find a place in the Bible where God decides someone's eternal destiny? 
We are given a role to play, but we can still choose to accept or deny eternity with God.

*verses 5-8*
Here we see a list of things that God blesses his believers with.
- Redemption
- Forgiveness
- Knowing the mystery of His will

**Q: What is God's mysterious will?**
Find a verse or two outside of Ephesians that describes God's plan for the world.

*verse 10*
His will: To unite all things in Him, things in heaven and things on earth.

Why it's mysterious: Why would God want connection with us? What can we possibly offer Him?

## Adopted
*verses 11 - 14*

*verse 5*
> He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will

Not a decision made after you've balanced your good and bad actions, or once you've proven anything. God chose you before you even existed.
He has decided you're worth it.

*verses 13-14*
> sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, the praise of his glory.

# Part 2: Thanksgiving and Prayer

### Quick recap
We are
1. Blessed - spiritually blessed, not just materially. 
2. Chosen - God's plan since the beginning was to unite humanity with himself. This gives us assurance that his plan is unwavering.
3. Adopted - Christians are adopted children of God to receive an eternal inheritance.

**Love for all the saints**: Significantly, Paul gave thanks not for their love for God, but for their **love for all the saints**. The real evidence of God’s work in us is not the love we claim to have for Him, but our love for His people that others can see ([1 John 4:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/4/20/s_1163020), [John 13:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/13/14/s_1010014) and [John 13:34-35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/13/34-35/s_1010034)).
