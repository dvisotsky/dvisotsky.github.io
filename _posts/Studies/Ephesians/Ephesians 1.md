# Context

Who wrote Ephesians? 
- *Paul*
When was Ephesians written? 
- *62 AD, while Paul was under house arrest in Rome.*
Why was Ephesians written?
- *Nothing against Ephesus, more to explain some of the great themes and doctrines of Christianity.* 
- *Some manuscripts have a blank space instead of "Ephesus." Perhaps this letter was intended to circulate among the early churches.*

Paul had spent 3 years in Ephesus, the people there were familiar to him.
One of the places where Paul took early Christians to a place other than the synagogue to learn more about the Way. (Acts 19)

Paul also indirectly caused a riot there (also Acts 19)


# Part 1: Spiritual Blessings in Christ
*verses 1 - 14*
## Blessed
*verse 3*
> Praise be to God who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

Material blessings are great, and we have an abundance of those as well. However as David Guzik says, "A new heart is better than a new coat."

## Chosen
*verse 4*
> For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.

**Q: Does God determine your destiny?**
With your group, find other places in the Bible where God chooses a specific purpose for people.
No repetitions allowed, so try to find more uncommon instances.

We see that there are many times where God decides what a person should be doing. Is that fair?

*Isaiah 4:59* (ESV)
> “Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker,  
    those who are nothing but potsherds  
    among the potsherds on the ground. 
    Does the clay say to the potter,  
    ‘What are you making?’ 
    Does your work say,  
   ‘The potter has no hands’?

That being said, did anyone find a place in the Bible where God decides someone's eternal destiny? 
We are given a role to play, but we can still choose to accept or deny eternity with God.

From the people we looked at, we know that God can and will use all kinds of people. 
But these people’s experiences are wildly different. Those who are against God do not have the same hope and assurance. 
Even if their paths may be similar in difficulty, those with God draw strength from knowing their Creator.


*verses 5-8*
Here we see a list of things that God blesses his believers with.
- Redemption
- Forgiveness
- Knowing the mystery of His will

**Q: What is God's mysterious will?**
Find a verse or two outside of Ephesians that describes God's plan for the world.

*verse 10*
His will: To unite all things in Him, things in heaven and things on earth.

Why it's mysterious: Why would God want connection with us? What can we possibly offer Him?

## Adopted
*verses 11 - 14*

*verse 5*
> He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will

Not a decision made after you've balanced your good and bad actions, or once you've proven anything. God chose you before you even existed.
He has decided you're worth it.

*verses 13-14*
> sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, the praise of his glory.

# Part 2: Thanksgiving and Prayer

_verses 15 - 22_

## Quick recap

We are

1. Blessed - spiritually blessed, not just materially.
2. Chosen - God's plan since the beginning was to unite humanity with himself. This gives us assurance that his plan is unwavering.
3. Adopted - Christians are adopted children of God to receive an eternal inheritance.

## Paul’s Cause for Prayer

_verse 15 - 16_

> Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers

We have a cause and effect here: Cause: "I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints" Effect: : "I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers"

> “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.

_- John 13:14_

> “By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”

_- John 13:35:_

Your love for people is the evidence of your love for God. If you say that you love God, if you go to His church and attend Bible Studies that study Him and His will, but you cannot show love to your parents, siblings, teachers, classmates, coworkers, and fellow believers, you are not known by Jesus.

_Matthew 7:23_

> "I never knew you; depart from me"

If you have constant friction with the people around you, carefully examine where it comes from. Are you doing everything you can to love those around you?

## Paul’s Substance of Prayer

_verses 17 - 23_

In these verses, Paul shares his prayer for the readers. His prayer is very dense, let’s unpack it into sections:

We’ll go through this first one together and then break out into groups. Pick one thing that Paul is praying for and unpack it into simpler terms. Tell us why this one stood out to you and what it means to you.

### “The spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him”

Questions:

- Does earthly wisdom exist?
- What are the differences between earthly wisdom and spiritual wisdom

### “The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; That you may know what is the hope of His Calling”

Give me your Eyes - Brandon Heath

Do you know the hope of His Calling?

### “What are the riches of the glory in His inheritance in the saints”

We can be sure that the things on Earth won’t last, good or bad. But eternity with God is our inheritance.

### “What is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe.”

Examples of God showing his great power to those who believe:

- Elijah
- Sickly woman in Matthew 9:22
- Leper in Luke 17:19
- Abraham

## Summary

_verses 22-23_

And he put all things under his feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills in all.

Jesus has won. Everything is under His feet.

Not of our power, but of His.

He is the head - the leader, we are the body - here to act out His will.
