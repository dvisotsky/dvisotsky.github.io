# Context
**Who is Caesar Augustus?** Tell me without looking
Okay, now you have 2 mins to research. 
- Rome used to be a republic. After the assassination of Julius Caesar, 3 men led the effort against the assassins - Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus. These 3 ruled as _de facto_ dictators.
- This Triumvirate tore itself apart from ambition and desire for more power.
- The one standing leader after years of civil war took control of the Roman Republic.
- This leader took over and became the founder of the Roman Empire. The first to call himself Caesar _Augustus_.
**Why does it matter?**
- These are real historical events. 
- The Bible is not separate from the rest of world history.
# The Census
"So all went to be registered"
One man commands, and the world responds. This is power.

But according to Roman Law, Mary was not required to accompany Joseph for the census.
**Q: So why did Mary come along, even though she was pregnant?**
- Because she is pregnant, under questionable conditions, Nazareth was probably not a comfortable place to be.

So they travel to Bethlehem, as the prophecy foretold. (Micah 5:2)
And in Bethlehem, in this anthill of activity and over-population, the savior of the world is born.

**Q: Why do you think God chose this place as the birthplace for his incarnation?**

The uphill climb of prophecy has led up to this climax, and now the roller-coaster is about to speed down and resolve all the potential energy of prophecy in a rush of kinetic glory.

Does Caesar Augustus know about this?
How the world is about to change?
**Q: What is Caesar Augustus' real name?**
History pivots on this moment, and not even Caesar, who is in command of the known world, will be remembered as much as this child who is born in a hectic and anxious time for Mary and Joseph.

# The Shepherds
> Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. _- Luke 2:8-9_

**Q: Why did the angels visit Shepherds?**
Shouldn't the religious leaders know about this?
- Humility is key. God knows who's primary reaction will be joy and acceptance, and who's heart is not yet ready.

> But Mary kept all these things and pondered _them_ in her heart. _- Luke 2:19_

**Q: What do you think she was pondering?**
So much must be going through her head. Fear, joy, anxiety, trust.


# The Temple
>they brought Him to Jerusalem to present _Him_ to the Lord _- Luke 2:22_

We still hold a custom similar to this today. Every now and then a baby gets brought on stage on Sunday morning to be blessed by the pastor.
In Jesus' case, his arrival was already awaited.
### Simeon's Prayer:
> “Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace,  
> According to Your word; 
> For my eyes have seen Your salvation 
> Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples, 
> A light to _bring_ revelation to the Gentiles, 
> And the glory of Your people Israel.” _- Luke 2:29-32_

Those who seek, find. _Matthew 7:7-12_
