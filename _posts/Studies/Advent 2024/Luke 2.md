# Context
**Who is Caesar Augustus?**
- Rome used to be a republic. After the assassination of Julius Caesar, 3 men led the effort against the assassins - Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus. These 3 ruled as _de facto_ dictators.
- This Triumvirate tore itself apart from ambition and desire for more power.
- The one standing leader after years of civil war took control of the Roman Republic.
- This leader took over and became the founder of the Roman Empire. The first to call himself Caesar _Augustus_.
**Why does it matter?**
- These are real historical events. 
- The Bible is not separate from the rest of world history.
# The Census
"So all went to be registered"
One man commands, and the world responds. This is power.

But according to Roman Law, Mary was not required to accompany Joseph for the census.
**Q: So why did Mary come along, even though she was pregnant?**
- Because she is pregnant, under questionable conditions, Nazareth was probably not a comfortable place to be.

So they travel to Bethlehem, as the prophecy foretold. (Micah 5:2)
And in Bethlehem, in this anthill of activity and over-population, the savior of the world is born.

The uphill climb of prophecy has led up to this climax, and now the roller-coaster is about to speed down and resolve all the potential energy of prophecy in a rush of kinetic glory.


Does Caesar Augustus know about this?
