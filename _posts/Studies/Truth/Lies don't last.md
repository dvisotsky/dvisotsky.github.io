- Lying is usually with the intent of immediate gain  
- The one who lies damages the relationship between people

 - Lying doesn't have to be to someone else, you can lie to yourself
	 - Pharisees about their righteousness
	 - Peter about his steadfastness
	 - Saul about the goodness of his sacrifice

**Applying Conclusions**
*Knowledge without application is useless, how can we use these conclusions in our lives?*

	- breakdown of trust between people
	- blemishes your image
 - Lying to yourself can be just as bad if not worse
	 - Disillusioned as to how well off you are in life
