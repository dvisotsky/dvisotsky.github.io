- Jesus left to Ephraim at the end of Ch 11
- Now the Passover is almost here and people are wondering if Jesus will show up

## Mary Anoints Jesus
> Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
> *- John 12:3*

### Why is Mary washing Jesus' feet?
**Context**
When a guest entered the home, usually the guest’s feet were washed with water and the guest’s head was anointed with a dab of oil or perfume. They were coming in with dusty sandals and likely sweat on their brow from being in the hot sun.
This was to refresh the guest and help them be more presentable.

To attend to the feet was the task of the most lowly slave. Mary shows great humility and devotion.

In her actions, Mary shows that she believes her expensive ointment is good enough only for the feet of Jesus, not even His head.

Not only that, but women in ancient Israel *rarely let down their hair* - it was a mark of loose morals. But here she does not stop to think of what the public reaction would be; *her only goal is to give everything she can to Jesus* while He is still with them.

### What makes Judas comment?
Judas breaks the awkward silence
- Who's is the ointment? *Mary's*
- Who is being anointed? *Jesus*
- So how does Judas fit in the picture?
	- He doesn't. How often do we butt in with opinions and advice when no one asked? This comes from a place of pride - you think you know better 
	- He doesn't understand the gesture because he doesn't believe like Mary does
	-
