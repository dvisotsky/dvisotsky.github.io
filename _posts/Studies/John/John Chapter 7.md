**Quick recap**
What happened in chapter 6, what was the main point?
- Jesus feeds 5000
- Jesus walks on water
- Jesus says "I am the bread of life"
# Feast of Booths 
Celebration of God's faithfulness during the Exodus. Families would camp in temporary tents made of branches and leaves for a week. 
Also celebrated the harvest. 
## Jesus' brothers urge him to go
Verses 1 - 13

*Who*: Jesus and His brothers
*What*: Feast of Booths
*When*: around harvest time
*Where*: from Galilee to Judea
*Why*:  
1. Why did the brothers think He should go?
	- Judea (Jerusalem) was the hub. If Jesus goes public there, everyone would see his miracles and get some bread.
2. Why did Jesus not want to?
	- It was not yet time to be so public to polarize the people. He knew the people could not handle the truth and just wanted some free food.

Jesus goes up to the feast anyway. Why?
	He didn't like his brothers?
	He changed his mind?
	He got FOMO and didn't want to miss out on the festival?

The festival was already gossiping about him and debating whether he was a 'good man' or 'leading the people astray.'

He went quiet-like, snuck in through the back so that people would not recognize him and ask for more bread and miracles.

## Jesus teaches in the temple
Verses 14 - 24
*Who:* Jesus
*What:* teaching about the Law
*When:* during the feast of Booths
*Where:* in the temple
*Why:* To explain the purpose of the Law

I thought Jesus wasn't trying to be public? Why is He teaching at the temple for everyone to see?
	To explain what the Law is for.
	he's not performing miracles here on purpose.

Jesus is throwing out challenges left and right:
- Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
He's challenging the people to check His teachings. "My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me."
He's telling them to compare His teaching with what the OT is meant to fulfill.
Look past the convoluted legalism to what God wanted for His people.

What is Jesus' goal with comparing himself to Moses?
- The end goal of the Sabbath and the Law is for us to live well, by God's design
- Even though the expectations that Jesus sets before us are difficult to follow through with, they are ultimately what leads to happiness and fulfillement. 

## "Can this be the Christ?"
Verses 25 - 36
The people were divide, this man spoke with authority and had something special about him, but he was from a town nearby, not from a cloud or a lightning bolt.

A popular belief was the the Messiah would *appear* - magically and suddenly.

## Living Water
Verses 37 - 52

Last day of the feast:
> The Feast of Tabernacles lasted eight days. All through the first seven days water from the Pool of Siloam was carried in a golden pitcher and poured out at the altar to remind everyone of the water God miraculously provided for a thirsty Israel in the wilderness. It seems that on the eighth day there was _no_ pouring of water — only prayers for water — to remind them that they came into the Promised Land.
