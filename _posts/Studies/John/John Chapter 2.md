## Water into Wine

**What can we imply about Jesus from his invitation to the wedding?**
- Jesus is good to have around in the good times ( we should invite him into our good times )

**"My hour has not yet come" - what does Jesus mean?**
- He has His own schedule and plan far beyond turning water into wine.
- God sees the bigger picture and when we want Him to fit our schedule we can get in the way.
- Jesus still performs the miracle, but not in a showy way - not even the chief steward knew where the wine had come from.

**The wine runs out**
- Social disgrace and disaster

**Six Stone water jars - for the Jewish rites of purification**
- Why were the water jars used? It's not a trick question, the answer is simple: Jesus uses whatever he has to work with
- He asks the servants to fill the jars - He doesn't magically make water (or wine) appear in them
- the servants filled the water jars to the brim, they did what was asked to the fullest extent

**John 1:51**
> And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

**John 2:11**
> This, the first of his *signs*, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.

**Conclusion:**
- The stone jars for Jewish purification - this is the beginning of the purification and renewal in Israel
- This was the first instance in John of Heaven coming down to meet Earth as a miracle, something that brings joy and wonder.
- Mary tell the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." When we follow her words we too can see Heaven and Earth collide 

## Temple Cleanse

**The temple was the center of the entire nation**
- Israel is led by God, and the temple is where God came to be in the midst of His people
- Time of the Passover - what is Passover?
	- Celebration of freedom (from slavery in Egypt)
	- What happened at the first Passover?
		- Jesus is now the sacrificial lamb

**Jesus overturns tables and drives out livestock**
- Does this mean that money and church should be separate?
- Selling animals for sacrifice in the temple was a long held custom. People traveled from far away and transporting livestock over long distances was dangerous and cumbersome. **So why was Jesus against it?**
- It had become corrupt. Scalpers drastically increased prices and the outer court became a noisy marketplace instead of a place of worship and prayer. (The outer court was the only place Gentiles were allowed into)

**The Jews ask what authority Jesus has to do this**
- A logical question - "Who died and made you the Temple Cleanser™?"
- Why is his response ironic?
	- The Jewish leader themselves do indeed "destroy his temple"
- "his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken." - after His death and resurrection they connected these dots


## Conclusion:
- We see Jesus making water into wine, a sign of *transformation*
* Jesus cleanses the temple and shows that the old ways need to be *changed*

**Transformation and Change are the first 2 steps in a Christian's life**
- have you been transformed? Do you trust Jesus to make you into something new?
- if you have, what change from the old ways has there been in your life? What tables need to be flipped that you're still holding on to?

"Do what he tells you" and you will see Heaven and Earth intersect
