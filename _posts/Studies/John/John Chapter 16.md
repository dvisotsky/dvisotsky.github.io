# Part 1
*verses 1 - 15*
## Recap
I am the true vine.
What happens to unfruitful branches?
What happens to fruitful ones?
## Context
*Where is Jesus?* They are all still in the same room they had dinner in. It's probably getting late.
*What time of year is it?* Passover is celebrated in the beginning of April

*What has Jesus been talking about?* "I have said these things to keep you from falling away."
## The world against you
John 16:1-4

The disciples will not have an easy life.

While Jesus was with his disciples, he was the sponge that soaked up the hatred of the world, now that his ministry is ending, his disciples will have to carry on and carry that weight themselves.

*Does anyone remember Travis's first joke during conference? About 2 guys on a bridge.*
>One guy finds that the other was thinking of jumping off and tries to talk him out of it. They find out that they're both Christians but slightly different denominations so the one guy just pushes the other off the bridge.

Most of history is not too far off from that. Religions have been fighting each other since the beginning, and a lot of the time the fighting even happens within one religion between people that understand it differently. That's actually one of the most common reasons that new Slavic churches pop up in Charlotte.

In the time of the disciples, it wouldn't be long until they were hunted - one of these persecutors was Saul who repented and ended up writing the majority of the new Testament. But before he came to truly know God, he was an enemy of God without even realizing it.

*What's your favorite villain from pop culture?*
I like Magneto - he is a mutant and survivor of the holocaust fighting for the rights of mutants and equality between all people. But often times he takes things too far and people die in the name of justice.

The villain thinks their acts are justified. The villain does what needs to be done for the  ultimate good - the definition of *good* being whatever they decide.

## For your good
John 16:5-15

Jesus again tells them that he must leave, but it's for the ultimate good of the disciples.
*Why couldn't he just stay forever?*  He is God, and he's already proven that death has no hold over Him, so why did he have to leave in the first place?

> It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will no come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.  - John 16:7

*Why is the Holy Spirit better than Jesus just staying here?*
Jesus can only be in one place at a time. The Holy Spirit is everywhere at once.
The disciples have their crutch removed and must now stand on their own faith that they've developed over their time with Jesus.

*Did it work?*
The disciples went on to carry Christianity to the known world and were able to preserve the words and actions for use to be able to read them. They lived and died for what they learned from Jesus.

*What does the Spirit do according to Jesus?*
John 16:8-11
### Convict of sin
**Because they do not believe in me**
Sin is a lack of faith in God's plan.

With the Holy Spirit, you will be able to see better when you are missing the mark.
Things that are normal by the world's standard will be out of the question for you because you can see where they lead.

*What sins do you think the Devil uses most for your generation?*
What are the cracks that he's found in the wall to slip through?

Things like laziness, slander, and apathy will set off alarms and you will know when you are straying from God's plan.
### Convict of righteousness
**Because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer**
We see Jesus as righteous. But the majority of people in his time saw him as a rebel and imposter.

*What does righteousness look like in our culture?*
Have you ever watched someone act or speak and think to yourself, "That's what a Christian should act like?"

What the world considers to be righteous and what Jesus consider righteous are quite different.

We are told to let God handle vengeance, and our job is to love people. Our righteousness is shown through our humility and love, not through having power over others or being better by comparison.
Righteousness does not come from money or status, but from how you treat others.
### Convict of judgement
**Because the ruler of this world is judged**
The Devil is awaiting judgement as is everyone who does not know Jesus.
As Christians, we know that we are on the winning side, and it's our duty to love those around us enough to save them from this judgement.
Strengthen each other for the journey and make disciples of the loners and outcasts in your classes and workplaces. 
Jesus did not care about ethnicity, politics, or social status. He only cared about the well-being of the people around him and the status of their soul.
## Part 1 Conclusion 
- The world is against us. The lies we are told to divide us are intended to disrupt unity and love.
- Jesus has always had a plan, and is still with us to help us on our journey.
- Connection with the Holy Spirit will lead us on the right path. 

# Part 2
*verses 16 - 33*
## Part 1 Recap
- **The world against you:** don’t let a good  get in the way of great. Tradition is good. Volleyball is good, fellowship is good, having close friends is good. 
- **Conviction:** reflect often. Recalibrate yourself if you feel empty - connect with Jesus and see what you need to adjust. 

## Sorrow into Joy
*verse 16 - 24*
### Do you see me?
*verses 16 - 18*
"Jesus, we do not understand"
> The disciples are confused - Jesus has not yet instituted a new kingdom on Earth as it was prophesied. If He is still to make it happen why is he going away? And if that was never His intent then why did he come in the first place?

**A little while, and you will not see me**
> "See me" - [_theōreō_](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2334/nkjv/tr/0-1/) 
> Discern who I am. The disciples will become discouraged and scattered because it will seem like Jesus and his mission are gone.

**And again a little while, and you _will_ see me**
Jesus will come back, and they will again see and understand. Better this time.

### Birthing pains
_verses 19 - 22_
"You will be sorrowful" - Jesus knows that hard times are coming. Does he have the power to stop them?

*Question: If Jesus could stop all this pain, for himself and His disciples, why didn't he?*

> Do you not realize that _I could call_ on my Father, and at once he _would_ provide me with more than twelve _legions of angels_? 
> - Matthew 26:53

Jesus could have avoided their sadness and his own pain.
But as the cliche goes - **no pain, no gain**.
And in the next few chapters we will see that the biggest gains require the most pain.

*So is pain necessary? If so, why?*
 > "The crucible for silver and the furnace for hold, but the Lord test the heart". 
 > _- Proverbs 17:3_

Difficulties show us who we really are and how much we care about other people.
Jesus is not here to help you avoid difficult times, His mission it to make you know how to navigate them in confidence and come out stronger than before.

It's easy to be kind when you had enough sleep, a solid breakfast, and traffic is light.
But how do you treat people that have nothing to offer in return for your attention, time, and kindness?

### Ask and Receive
*verses 23 - 24*
> "Whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you."
> *- John 15:23*

If you need help in doing God's will, He will never withhold it from you.
>  "So that your joy may be full."

The greatest joy is fulfilling the purpose you were created for. 

## Overcoming the World
*verses 25 -33*
At the beginning of this section Jesus summarized his mission:
- I came from the Father - Jesus is divine
- Into the world - Jesus loved the world enough to become a part of it
- Again I leave the world and go to the Father - Jesus' mission has a goal and he is soon to complete it

> Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.
> *- John 16:30*

Now, after Jesus has washed their feet and spent the last 3 chapters encouraging them, they are ready to believe.
They are excited and eager, but Jesus sees past this burst of enthusiasm: 
> Do you now believe? Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone.
> - John 16:31

It is easy to believe when things are going well, but we just talked about in the previous section that difficulties are necessary to make us stronger.
There's no point in being nice if you only do it when it's convenient. That's just manipulation.

The conclusion here though is positive:
> Take heart, I have overcome the world.

Jesus has already won.
