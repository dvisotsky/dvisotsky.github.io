# Recap
Prayer - for unity and protection of Jesus' disciples
What celebration is taking place?

# In the Garden
The other Gospels specify that this was the garden of Gethsemane.

> "Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples."

This was a familiar place to them – going here after dinner was not unusual.
Across *the brook Kidron*: this creek served as drainage from the temple in Jerusalem. During this celebration the blood of the sacrificed lambs would have been enough to dye the water reddish.

The other gospels give some more detail about what happened in the garden.
**Look up these records and find out what happened before Judas arrives.**

After prayer, Judas arrives.
> Then Judas, having received a detachment _of troops,_ and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. *- John 18:3*
 
In charge of a band of soldiers – he seems to have expected opposition. They also brought lanterns and torches, this detail reminds us of what time it is - this is a night raid.

Did Jesus oppose them? *No, he de-escalates the situation*
Who tried to stand up for Jesus?

Does God need our protection?
Peter thought so, and he had the right intentions, but his mission was not aligned with Jesus'

## In Denial
There are 3 times that Peter denies Jesus.
Find them and write down Peter's reasoning for each time.

1. Called out by the girl watching the door. She doesn't know him but his knee-jerk reaction is to deny Jesus.
2. Warming by the fire - close enough to see what happens but far enough away to avoid   trouble. Peter gets called out by a relative of the man who's ear he chopped off.
3. Now the people around him are pretty sure that he's with Jesus. It's probably time to give up on the bluff. But no, Peter charges on and denies Jesus again.

 
<<<<<<## On Trial
Do the officials know what Jesus is being accused of?
Does Jesus know what he's being accused of?
Do the Pharisees know why they arrested Jesus? What are the charges?

Fair trial?
Look up _Matthew 26:1-5_
Was this the Pharisees plan?

No, everything is going sideways. 
This is a chaotic arrest and trial, and at the eye of the storm is Jesus. 
Confident and calm.

The truth does not need noise or anger. The next time you try to justify anger, slander, or anything that tries to put others down, examine your justification. Is it as hollow as the Pharisees's reasons for bringing Jesus to court?
