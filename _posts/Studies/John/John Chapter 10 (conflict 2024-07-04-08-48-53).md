**Context**
What happened last time?
    Jesus healed a blind man.
    The pharisees did not like that.
What's the overarching theme?
    Who is Jesus? Is He God or a crazy man?
## The Good Shepherd
*verses 1 - 6*
*Q: Why do you think Jesus is using the analogy of a Shepherd specifically? (Why not a general or builder or farmer?)*
- A shepherd knows his sheep, by name.
- Sheep know their shepherd by his voice.
- The shepherd's goal is the safety and well-being of the herd.
- A shepherd was also a common analogy for a *king*- which is quite different form how we think of important people today.
  - *Q: How many of you have seen an important leader like a CEO or President?*
  - In this analogy, the king knows his people personally and his goal is to protect them, not gain power or money. The relationship pictured here is much more intimate.

*Q: What does it mean to "climb up some other way?" (verse 1)*
- we have this image of a "gate" or proper way of entry, so what does it mean to come into the sheep the wrong way?
- *A:* The intention. The gate is for the shepherd who cares for the sheep, but thieves are there for personal gain. You can determine which one you are by what you think about while you're at church - is it the people and how you can connect with them or is it how you can put yourself on a good volleyball team or feel good about yourself by talking about other people behind their back?
- We have no sheep to steal at FSBC, but we have youth and newcomers who can tell if someone is genuine and cares about them or if they're just here to have fun, eat free food, gossip, and play volleyball.

> When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. (ESV) - John 10:4

Here we see that the shepherd doesn't use a stick or a border collie to get the sheep to obey him. The herd understands that the shepherd has their best interest in mind and will follow him wherever he leads.


**Summary of 1 - 6**
- Jesus is the shepherd
- He knows his sheep individually
- His intention is to keep the sheep safe and care for them
- The sheep respond to his voice
- He does not drive his sheep but leads them - and they follow him

*verses 7 - 15*
"I am the door of the sheep"
    I thought Jesus was the shepherd, what's this now?
    Also, why does He compare Himself to a door?

This is still the same analogy - the shepherd *was* the door.
He would lay down across the entrance to the sheep pen at night to keep the sheep in and predators out.
His life is on the line for the sake of his sheep.


> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. (ESV)
> - John 10:10

*Q: Who is the thief?*
Anyone who's purpose is selfish and not for the benefit of God's people - or all people.

*Q: What is the thief trying to steal, kill, and destroy?*
Some may say the thief is only trying to help the sheep have a good time while the shepherd has them locked up in the pen.

*Q: What does it mean to have "life abundantly"?*
- Abundant life isn’t an especially long life.
- Abundant life isn’t an easy, comfortable life.
- Abundant life is a life of satisfaction and contentment in Jesus.
> “Life is a matter of degrees. Some have life, but it flickers like a dying candle, and is indistinct as the fire in the smoking flax; others are full of life, and are bright and vehement.” (Spurgeon)

From this comes the question: *Is your life abundant, and if not, what is missing?*
Like verse 14 says, "I know my own and my own know me"

Jesus wants you to trust Him, and He proved long ago that He doesn't care about the mistakes that you've made.
Jesus wants to give you life, and life abundant, but you have to trust Him as the shepherd and decide if He is your leader or if you're still down to get stolen from the flock and eaten by thieves or wolves.
