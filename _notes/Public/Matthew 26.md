# Setting the scene

It is 2 days before Passover

- "When Jesus finished all these sayings" - Jesus is done teaching
- We are getting ready for the culmination of Jesus' mission on Earth, we can feel it looming like a rock wall in front of us.

The chief priests and elders are plotting together about how to get rid of Jesus. (verse 3)

- _Passover itself has become_ a political factor in their strategy, it is no longer a celebration of freedom but _a hindrance_ to their plan. (They are afraid that the public will get in the way of a public arrest of Jesus)

Jesus is visiting Simon the leper when a woman pours expensive ointment on his head. (verses 6 - 13)

- Jesus defends the woman against the disciples' incredulity at her 'waste' of something so expensive
- _how often do we step in to defend others when we know that someone is being treated unfairly?_
- John 12 shows that this was Mary, the sister of Lazarus and Martha
- I think this ties in with our previous talks of giving to the homeless. [Matthew 25:35-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A35-40&version=ESV)

# Passover

Why was unleavened bread eaten during this time?

- Symbol of **haste** - during the Exodus there was no time to make leavened bread before the Israelites had to flee
- Symbol of **purification** - leaven/yeast was associated with fermentation and decay. Removing leaven from your bread was to symbolize sin being removed from your life.

Jesus and his disciples share a meal at an unnamed man's house and Jesus says, "_Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me._"

- The disciples didn't instantly know who Jesus was referring to - Judas didn't stick out as the misbehaving disciple or the crooked one. In fact he was the treasurer, a position typically given to a trustworthy and smart person.
- Jesus knew **betrayal** was coming. Someone that he spent the last 3 years with, someone that the other disciples didn't suspect.
- Judas chose something material over his relationship with Jesus
  - any time we choose _things_ over _people_, we lose


## closing thoughts

Judas and Peter are not that different. Peter also betrayed Jesus, denied him 3 times, and went back to fishing after Jesus died as if the last 3 years didn't happen.  
  
We have almost finished the book of Matthew and gone on the journey with Jesus just as the disciples did.
Are we different than the disciples in our understanding of Jesus' mission?  
  
- If we are less confused about what Jesus' goal than the disciples were, do our actions and values reflect that?
- It is up to us to either take what we've learned to heart and live it out or go back to our regular lives as if we don't know Jesus.
