Key verse: Colossians 3:12-13

> 12 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

Opening question:

- What are your pet peeves?
  - finger pointing ( this guy at work loves to point out other people's mistakes and make sure he's never blamed for anything )
- How do you react?
  - I'll get passive-aggressive and make sure that guy knows when he's at fault for something

Kicking it up a notch, we'll go from pet peeves to criminal activity

## Introducing Jean Valjean

Les Misérables clip: 6:39-11:00

- Jean has just been released from 20 years in prison and is on parole (forever).
- Has had it very rough, not able to get a job because of his record.
- Has not been shown kindness in a long time.

**Discussion questions:**

- Why did Jean steal even though the priest had shown him kindness?
  - evil nature? hurt by the world and just trying to survive? doesn't know another way?
- Did Jean deserve forgiveness and more silver on top of what he already stole?
  - justice was not served
- What do you think Jean does after this encounter?
- Look up a verse that you think the priest had read that morning

**Luke 11:4:**

> and forgive us our sins,  
>    for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.

**Romans 12:19-21**

> 19Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” 20To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Closing questions:

- What is the biggest hinderance to the spread of Christianity in our culture?
  - fake Christians
  - lukewarm Christianity (Revelation 3:15-16)
- What is our goal as Christians?
  - "Take up your cross and follow me" - Matthew 16:24
  - Forgive as Jesus forgave

Colossians 3:12-13

> 12 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

To bear:

- carry the weight of, support
- endure

Matthew 16:24:

> Then Jesus said to His disciples: "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
