*Samaritan woman at Jacob's well*
# Part I
 *Main points*
- Jesus did not come to save just Israel, but the broken and ostracized
- If we know Jesus, we have the spring of living water 

**Read Verses 1-6**
## Jesus travels *through* Samaria
- *Q:* Why did Jesus have to travel in the first place?
	- The Pharisees were growing angry with Jesus making disciples
	- *A:* He was avoiding a confrontation with the Pharisees, He knew it was not time yet
- *Q:* Why did Jesus choose to travel through Samaria?
	- Samaritans were half-breed Israelites. During the Assyrian rule, all but the lowest class Israelites were exiled from Samaria. Those left blended their families and culture with Gentiles of the region.
	- *A:* Jesus wasn't racist. He came to save the broken, Samaritans were the target audience.
## They come to Jacob's well
- The well offers a a chance to rest, even though it was only the [6th hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_hour) of the day (noon).
- This is relatable to us, we have all felt tired and hot and in need of cold water.
- *Q:* Why do you think Jesus stayed outside the city?
	- Because He didn't want to deal with Samaritans?
	- Why not just go and do a miracle in the market? They would all believe probably.
	- Too tired?
	- He knew the woman was coming

**Read verses 7-15**
## Jesus meets the Samaritan woman
- Typically, even to this day, women travel together, yet she is here alone, in the heat of the day, to draw water.
- *Q:* Why was she here now, and why was she alone?
	- Even among Samaritans, she is on the fringes of society
- *Q:* Why would Jesus want to talk to her? The fact that she's alone and coming at a weird time are red flags
	- the woman is questioning his actions
	- risk gossip, impurity, temptation
- Jesus doesn't care about your nationality, your mistakes, your place in society. He is here to bring heaven to earth and that means breaking down cultural boundaries that are meant to put some people above others.
## **Jesus and the woman talk about water**
-  "Living Water" could also refer to moving water, water that has less bacteria because it is not stagnant
- Jesus: "If you knew who I was, you'd be asking me for water"
	- He is making her curious about who he is and what he has to offer
	- If you knew Jesus better, you would want more what he has to offer
	
>  "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” 
>  *John 4:14*

- *Q:* What does he mean by "a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life"?
	- *A:* you will be able to provide for others yourself
	
"What if I feel like my spring has dried up? I used to have it but I don't feel the same anymore"
- Drink again, go to the source, reconnect

## Food for thought
Are we aware of our brokenness and searching for healing?
How do we decide who is worthy of our love?
Do we exclude people in our lives because of the mistakes that they've made?
## Action
- Take a minute to note who in your life seems like the Samaritan Woman. Give them a nickname if you're afraid of people peeking at your notes.
	- Pray for them this week, and talk to them if you're not a chicken
- If you feel like you don't have the spring of living water that Jesus is talking about, write down why you think that is and what you could do to fix it. 
- If you think you already have the living water, write down what you've been doing with it and who you've been giving it to.

# Part II
## "I who speak to you am He" 
*Q:* "Go, call your husband, and come here", is Jesus randomly changing the subject?
*A:* No, he understands that he is pushing social boundaries and having the husband there would be more appropriate. He also knows what buttons to press

*Q:* Why does the woman respond with a question about worship?
- *A:* to avoid the question, to skirt confronting her mistakes

Jesus tells her that soon it won't matter and no one will debate where worship should happen.
He also *reveals who he is*, he didn't do that for anyone else. Not at the wedding, not to the Pharisees, but to this woman who is not accepted by anyone.
*Q:* Why did Jesus choose her?

*Rhetorical Q:* Would you have chosen her?
Someone who everyone else looks down one, if you are in her company your status is automatically brought down.

Jesus did not spend time with those who had the Bible memorized, they felt like they already knew everything.
Jesus sought those who needed healing, and knew that they were not whole.
