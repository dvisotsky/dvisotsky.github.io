I like the text formatting and webbing, but $10 a month is kinda steep for a note taking app, personally. If anything I figure I can set some kind of synced folder up myself. Anyway here's my snapshot of life: kids_camp camp was last week, got back 2 days ago. Solid camp, Inna and I were in charge of skits this year, and we did it coed style with boys and girls all in the same space, under the kitchen. It worked out pretty well, almost everyone made a bleached shirt, and we ran out of freezer paper on day 3 (which is fine because we were supposed to move on to the next craft anyway). My team was Max V, Tim T, and Emik S. Really solid, reliable dudes. Max made the launcher for bottle rockets and that was a blast, I made one with slanted fins that would spin to keep steady on the way up and it worked pretty well. Inna had Yana, Mimi, and Marina and tbh they sandbagged a bit. Yana was at sports sometimes, Mimi was kinda chatty with other youth, Marina was a handful before camp started with her scheduling issues with her Chapel Hill life. Inna definitely carried more weight. We shared a cabin for most of the week which was really nice, just us two across the lake in the last cabin on the left. I consider a fan a necessity now, and this year we bought a minifridge too, it's chilling in my room now. I stayed up til at least 12:30 every night, doing crafts and talking with the youth. I feel self conscious about being older than them but I don't think they actually mind me being there. I like to think that I fit in pretty well. The last night I was on the blob tower until around 2:30, talking about life goals, telling scary stories, talking about dreams and seeing the future. Danik K wants to buy a property and get into real estate, Andrew Buts wants financial freedom and to not worry about money at all, Anna Mogorean wants a skydiving license and her own parachute. I said I wanted to get strong enough to do the Dirty Dancing lift with Inna. I got some adjustable dumbbells for my birthday, now the only trick is consistence. After camp I've felt more energetic, but I can feel it already fading into complacency, I need to keep up the exercise to grow stronger (and healthier) I figure it's likely I won't write again this week so I'll mention that we're going disc golfing on Friday with Michael Derkachev, his wife Diana, Max and Natasha, Jason, and maybe a few others. Also Vlad Makarchuk asked me to cosign on an apartment since he has no credit history. Inna is strongly against it but I feel like I should. I still want to get a better understanding of the situation and potential consequences, so we'll see. Inna is starting at UNCC in a week or so and that's already a big financial commitment. I'm still at #Wastequip, and I like it.","title":"2023 08 09"},{"location":"Journal/2023-08-09/#kids_camp-camp-was-last-week-got-back-2-days-ago","text":"Solid camp, Inna and I were in charge of skits this year, and we did it coed style with boys and girls all in the same space, under the kitchen.

It was super busy so I didn't really get to skate and the wifi was weird so I wasn't as productive as I hoped to be. Tomorrow is Anthony's last day in person, I got him a Kool Aid shirt since that's one of his most used gifs. Also applied for 2 jobs in the last two weeks. Prepping for Bible study now, I've been leading them every other week for a few months now, Yarik and I are trading off. Today is on Prayer, you can take a look here: [[Prayer Life]]. Disc golf has been the new hobby, Inna and I went to Mint Hill Veteran's park yesterday to play a round and I'm finally getting used to the used discs I bought I think. Still had a +3 at the end I think but I'm improving. Been playing with Ivan, Max, Michael Derkachov, Tim Tsiro, and a few others. Apparently a lot of the youth is into it. I also have been gaming a lot less. I still play on the little emulator (RG35XX) and I recently moved the CRT into my room to use that at the display and it's pretty cool. Yoshi's Island is my favorite right now. But in general I want to learn more coding, I started learning Flask last week but haven't gotten back into it recently. I really like that we've been getting outside more, for volleyball or disc golf or just a walk in the park.

My current focus is my family and my job. I feel I've gotten too comfortable in both and do not put in the effort that is needed to stand out and make progress as a leader of my family and an experienced engineer on my dev team. I have been studying the Bible deeper for our Monday Small group, for youth Bible Studies, and for Awana, but it seems these areas of my life are still falling behind. So not to sound sad or start this back up with a downtrodden attitude, but I believe I am capable of being a better leader and I've seen my own sparks of growth. I think this entry itself is a testament to some measure of awareness and I hope to keep the momentum going and have a rhythm to these writing that is more frequent than the first few.","title":"2024 03 12"},{"location":"Journal/2024-03-17/","text":"Back Lilia's funeral was yesterday. She passed away last Saturday in the afternoon while Inna, Marina, and I were at Benny's Pizza in NoDa. It's been a long week. I saw a lot of family this weekend, most of them came into town on Friday for the family viewing. I missed Awana that day but Eliana led what looked like an awesome lesson about Paul's mission trips - they had a fake campfire on the room and made s'mores. We got to see the Petrashes and VA cousins, and Inna and I drove dedushka home on Friday night and stayed for a while and chatted about our family and all the photos on his walls. He's become a lot softer and kinder since the months I lived with him at his house. Or maybe I just didn't read the vibe properly back then. David Petrash seems more humble, he reached out a couple times in the last few weeks over Insta and text, I have hopes that he's changing for the better. He might come to Wyoming with our family later this spring, I hope he does. We also gathered at Danik and Kristina's house for the first time yesterday with the cousins. It was pretty great to just talk and spend time together. He showed us his coffee roaster and I'm low-key interested in getting into it. I feel like I could write for a really long time to catch future me up, maybe I should write more often. I feel pretty drained but thankful for the time with family. Lilia's passing hit me pretty hard and I think I'll still be recovering for a while. I woke up this morning and thought about how Yura has to wake up every day knowing that Lilia isn't in the bed next to him and never will be again. I feel like I became pretty reclusive even when In a went to Russia for a few weeks, I can't imagine who I'd become if she wasn't with me for the rest of my life. They're all very strong through it all though. We took the Shmakov kids hiking on Saturday, the day after their mom died and they were able chat and joke and enjoy it. I'm very impressed. I'm realizing more how much I need God to help me with my anger and pessimism at the world. My current chess ELO is 624 for Blitz which is what I've been playing most and 1089 for rapid.","title":"2024 03 17"},{"location":"Journal/2024-03-21/","text":"Back Walk through the front door The sun sets on a long day Your voice means I'm home","title":"2024 03 21"},{"location":"Journal/2024-04-09%20%28%20goodbye%20wastequip%20%29/","text":"Back womp womp. Guess who got laid off today. James, Riley, and me. Thus ends the Wastequip saga. I overslept this morning because we're usually working remote on Tuesdays but since the solar eclipse was yesterday and Cody went to Indiana to watch it we switched the days. Not sure how that makes sense since Cody was off today as well but I digress. I got to the office at like 9 and was surprised to see Riley there as well since he's been fully remote for a couple months now. I chatted with Ben and Michael a little and settled in to fix bugs (it's a bug fixing sprint) and I has just pushed a fix that would fix a bunch of the reports not rendering properly. At like 9:45 Mike came over and called me, James, and Riley into a conference room and I felt something was off the moment I saw a lady I'd never met waiting in the conference room. Mike explained that we'd not been able to hit the required milestones and that we wouldn't be able to go to market this year. Due to that the Wasteware team would be restructuring and we were being let go. I was still a little surprised at how sudden it felt but I guess that's better than stewing over it. Michael and Ben were pretty freaked out about the news, I think Michael teared up a little and Ben was really worried. But it looks like they'll be staying on the team, Wasteware probably just doesn't need heavy hitters anymore; Michael texted later saying that it'll likely be broken up into smaller applications. My thoughts on this are that the timing is kinda off, I'd much rather have gotten laid off after the project with Nik is on it's feet (it's called Gather and it'll be an event management platform ) but in general I feel alright with moving on. I just hope I can find a job within the month because our savings are pretty small at the moment. I felt at peace leaving the office but sad that I didn't get to spend more time with the team, I'll miss those guys. I trust God and whatever's coming next, right now I feel like this time around I'm more confident and will have an easier time navigating the job application field. The project with Nik will keep me busy and I still have Awana and Bible Study to keep me occupied. Also I'm getting back into video games after Lent, I booted Cassette Beasts up for the first time in a long time and it was a great time.","title":"2024 04 09 ( goodbye wastequip )"},{"location":"Journal/2024-04-09%20%28Charleston%29/","text":"Back This past weekend we went to Charleston with my family and Babushka. Inna and I left on Friday later in the morning after my standup meeting and I finished work at a coffee shop once we got there (Second State) and then we met up with everyone else (except dad) in the city. By this point I think everyone was a little tired from the trip and I was feeling kinda frustrated but we had a good time just walking around the city. Towards evening Inna and I stopped by Mod Pizza to grab dinner for everyone and we headed back to the hotel. Inna and I shared a suite with Max and Natasha and Mom, Ivan, Polina, and Babushka had their own suite. In the morning Mom and Polina woke up early and went for a 10k run over the bridge while Inna and I took Ivan and Babushka to Waffle House for breakfast with Max and Natasha. Then we all met up in the city and got coffee at Idle Hands which was my favorite coffee spot of the trip. I just got an Americano (I've been having those a lot more recently lately) and it was was a very smooth and light taste. The pour overs were also really good. Then we did a bunch of Touristy walking around and towards late afternoon we went to the beach for some group photos. Oh we also went to Fort Sumter which was cool, we got some funny photos there with the cannons. I also liked the photo of the watch tower with the nautical flags (I'm still not sure what they mean, we tried looking them up later) At the beach there were a lot of sand fleas but we still got some nice photos, some passerby took one with me in it ( I was carrying the camera around for the trip to learn how to use it) We got home pretty late, at around 9 I think, and made stir fry. Everyone helped out and it turned out pretty good, we had a ton left over though. On the last morning we went to Holey CIty bagels without Mom and Polina and Babushka since they woke up early and went for coffee even though we agreed on a time and place the night before. Ivan went with Inna and I and we stood in like for like 15 minutes (the line was out the door) I don't really get the hype but it was nice to just spend the time and not worry about anything. We met up with Mom's group after and went to Sightsee coffee which was also very good, they have a ginger beer tonic permanently on the menu which I'd forgotten about. There were some cool photos there too that I liked, I had to go across the street to get far away enough to take the shot. Max and Natasha left after coffee but the rest of us headed to Folly Beach for some sun. Except it was cold and windy lol. There were still a lot of people on the beach but I ended up putting on a hoodie and nobody swam. Ivan did a sick flip there and I'm glad I got a photo of it because he landed on hard sand and bruised both of his heels. Now he walks on his toes. Babushka left back home today but we visited parents last night to share photos with Padre and say bye to babushka. Her flight should be taking off any minute now.","title":"2024 04 09 (Charleston)"},{"location":"Journal/2024-04-27%20Keowee/","text":"Back I'm at Lake Keowee, we drove up after Awana yesterday and boy what a day we've had. It started off great - I felt very rested sleeping in a hammock and the weather was perfect in the morning. I brought our new camera (Olympus OM-D EM5 Mark III) and was still getting familiar with it during our hike after breakfast. I like it but it has limitations when it comes to low light. I'm hoping the lens I ordered yesterday will help with that. But since it's obviously pretty bright during the day outside I think I got some good shots. Anyways about halfway through the hike I realized I didn't have the car keys with me, I'd left them in the car. I also left my wallet and we had the MacBook, iPad, and a bunch of other stuff in the car. I thought to myself that hikers are generally kind people and hopes for the best. I couldn't shake the nervousness, but decided to not tell Inna so she wouldn't worry. I figured if something were to happen I wouldn't be able to make it back in time anyway. We hiked for like 2 hours I think, and when we got back to the car I was relieved to see that it was still where I left it, and the keys, wallet, iPad, and MacBook were still there. We had offered to make lunch and I'd cooked some chicken and veggies the day before for burritos so when we got back to the campsite I began slicing tomatoes for toppings. The knife was kinda dull and I remembered that id brought the folding knife that Misha had gifted me a few years ago. I went to grab it from the car but couldn't find the backpack where I'd put it. I asked Inna if she'd seen it and then realized that it could've gotten stolen. We searched for a bit and I noticed that the new camera bag we'd bought was also not in the car. Hoping they'd turn up we decided to change and go paddle boarding. But our suitcase was also not in the car. That's when called the police. We were missing the suitcase with all our clothes for the weekend, both toiletries bags, Inna's makeup, my backpack, and the camera bag. I reported a theft and they said they'd send out a deputy to get a report going. While we waited for someone to arrive Valera and Natasha drove to where we hiked to see if they could find anything. Things felt pretty bleak and I considered just going home. It'd been probably an hour since we realized we'd been robbed, I felt heavy in my gut even though all that stuff was replaceable. It just put a cloud over the trip. Then Natasha sent a Snapchat showing that they found the camera bag and make-up! That alone was enough to raise my spirits and I was so thankful. They finally returned and pulled out the suitcase from their car too! They'd found everything except Inna's toiletries bags with her toothbrush and deodorant. 5 mins after Officer Campbell pulled into the campsite. We explained the situation and he asked if anything was missing. We talked and ended up chatting a bit, he was very talkative. I ended up not filing a police report - we got all the bags back and the only things missing were a camera Lens that I was going to return, my Gameboy emulator, and my Sony earbuds. All in all less than $500 so not worth an insurance claim and that stuff didn't really have a chance of being found. We ended up going back with Natasha and Valera to where the found our stuff on the side of the road and found a random schoolgirl's backpack and Inna's toothbrush bag. Everything was ok. I still feel guilty for leaving the keys but Inna was very understanding and supportive. I've still got the keys in my pocket now, I don't think I'll ever leave them in the car like that again. After all that we still went paddle boarding for a while and then had shashlik for dinner at like 10. God is good, this could've been a lot worse but I'm not even mad about the stuff we did lose. It showed me how I didn't fully rely on God through this trial. I'd prayed for our stuff to be not stolen when I realized that I'd forgotten the keys but when I found out it did I never stopped to pray about what would happen next. I just kind of resigned to the fact that we'd have to buy new stuff. Which isn't totally bad - I was ready to let those things go but I think I should seek first what Gods plan is in all this instead of just \"oh well, guess that's that.\" Tomorrow we want to go paddle boarding again and hit Greenville on the way home for some Indian Food.","title":"2024 04 27 Keowee"},{"location":"Journal/2024-07-03%20new%20job/","text":"Back It's been a minute. Or like 2 months lol. Red Ventures Last couple entries I was unemployed, but last week I started at Red Ventures and am currently having a good time . Darwin is a Sr. Engineer and has been helping me get onboarded, I've mostly been going through a Vue course on Udemy since that's the framework we're using, but today I switched to Node.js to learn backend since Vue is pretty straightforward. I should backtrack a bit on how I landed here. Spectrum Medical, Atypic, and Lowe's were other places I interviewed at. Atypic was easy work but could only pay like 80k a year, I liked the company but yeah that wouldn't be optimal. Spectrum Medical makes cool products - perfusion machines - and their software product would track data live as well as generate reports. It had a similar vibe to Wastequip actually, it was in Fort Mill though and required 5 days in office for the first 6 months. And I didn't really see an opportunity for growth there. Lowe's would have been really cool, with the location in South End and probably some good chances to grow in position. I fumbled the technical interview though - couldn't write a custom React Hook on the spot and forgot what Higher Order Components were. I knew that stuff but the terminology tripped me up and I was a bit nervous. So here we are, at Red Ventures. Eddie Herbert actually referred me to the position and I'll be working on his team. We're building a product to connect people to insurance providers, it's called Coverage and Eddie thinks it could get pretty big. I already mentioned Darwin, he's pretty cool. Married with a little girl and 2 dogs. He likes watching TV and restraurants. Kristi is a Staff Engineer that's a little more reserved but she's cool too, she goes to jiu jitsu classes and used to be the Engineering Manager but stepped down not that long ago. Nina is the Team Leader (I forget the actual title but she manages Jira and assigns work to people). She's from a marketing/business background and this is a new role for her, she seems stressed about it but according to Eddie the team is doing fine. There are a lot more names and people but these are the first I've met and had the most interactions with in my first week. This 2nd week has been very quiet - we get Thursday and Friday off for Independence Day and most of the team is out. Hopefully next week I'll pick up tickets and get some actual work done. I still stay in touch with Ben and Michael - actually it's mostly Michael that reaches out to me but I want to get coffee with them at Hex in the next couple weeks. Probably not next Friday cuz I'm going to Nantahala for the weekend. Bible Study Bible Study is tonight, I'm leading it on the 2nd part of [[John chapter 10]]. I think I'm getting better at leading them but it still feels clunky at times when I don't put in the proper prep time and have good discussion questions though. That's on me and my time management. Inna and I talk kind of frequently about our roles at church, we don't really have friends our own age and are more of mentors to the youth I guess. It doesn't bother me most of the time but several times in the past year (or few I guess) I've considered plugging into a community group at Vizion church in hopes of finding people our age. Hobbies I bought like 5 games in the past couple weeks. Bullets Per Minute is my favorite so far, idk how much I'll play the others. But looks like I'm in the gaming tide, I expect after a month or few I'll get tired and focus more on coding or other stuff. Then again maybe Red Ventures will keep me learning fast enough that I won't need to outside of work. I also just purchased a Ferris Sweep today and am excited to try out choc switches. We went disc golfing a few times in the past few months and I'm itching to go again just to be outside and moving more. I have a daily reminder to do 30 pushups but it's not enough to feel stagnant at the end of the day. Been getting better at chess though, I think I'm at around 750 in Blitz. Gather I'm on Nik's payroll to help build an app for conference but haven't touched it since I started the new job. My goal there was to learn more backend but since were using Supabase it's mostly clicking around - I guess that requires knowledge of theory but it won't help me know any specific frameworks like Django or Node.js. If I can balance RV and Gather there's a chance Gather could get big and I'd be a founder, but that's all speculation and a few years away at least probably.","title":"2024 07 03 new job"},{"location":"Journal/2024-07-03%20new%20job/#red-ventures","text":"Last couple entries I was unemployed, but last week I started at Red Ventures and am currently having a good time .

But this guy didn't want to fight. He saw that his friend was not making the right choices in life lately, and even though their parents were friends he saw that they were drifting apart. This camper expressed that he wanted to grow closer to God but whenever he hung out with this friend he ended up doing things that made him feel guilty. The kicker was that he did not have any ill will towards his friend even though the friend had been wanting to square up and fight and was pestering the boy all day. The boy was trained in karate and knew he could take his friend down if he wanted to, but refused to do so because it would embarrass his friend. My goal in telling you this is for you to examine what kind of friend you are to those around you. In your friend group, what is your role? Do you elevate those around you or are you the one coming up with ideas that will cause guilt later? We've seen a real life example, let's see what the Bible says about it. How often should you forgive? Then Peter came up and said to him, \"Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\" Jesus said to him, \"I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven\" - Matthew 18:21-22 How do you resolve conflict? If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses - Matthew 18:15 Don't be afraid to talk things out with people. Miscommunication is the root of like 90% of arguments. Bottling things up and venting to your friends only serves to build up grudges and spread gossip.

Intro Question: What is Identity? - A sense of who we are as individuals and as members of communities/groups * The lens through which you see the world and make choices - Identity is what gives you your sense of self and sense of worth. Genesis 1:26-28 - God creates man. * This was a long time ago, and we have learned to obtain our identity from other things. * Question: Where do people get their identity from in current society? * from within? from possessions? from other people ? Tangent(probably won\u2019t cover in Bible Study): * This is different than personality. * Personality is the way you show yourself to others, your humor, fashion, hobbies, etc. self awareness is not necessary. * Identity is the way you esteem yourself. It shapes the choices you make; it is your core values and the lens through which you see the world. \"My identity comes from my inner feelings\" is a lie, we require validation from outside ourselves. We're not proud of having money, we're proud of having more money than the people around us. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better-looking than others. If someone else became equally rich, or clever, or good-looking there would be nothing to be proud about. It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. - CS Lewis, Mere Christianity Any identity that is achieved rather than received is excluding, it gets its worth from the people below that achievement. We cannot give ourselves our own identity, we need validation because of our nature. Love and approval are essential to our identity. \u201cThe praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards\u201d - JRR Tolkien Validation from other people fails. Any person you trust will disappoint you, because you are both imperfect. Hence the best validation must come from one who is most praiseworthy. Psalm 139 So if God gives us our identity and we accept it, what does that mean for us? Question: What does it mean to be made in the image of God? * We are not omnipotent or omnipresent. * What aspects of God's character should we imitate? God loves His creation. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. So, we are not created in the image of fast cars or fashion or how many chapters of the Bible you read every day. Those are all things of various importance but they are not where our identity comes from. Us and the rest of humanity were created in God\u2019s image, and should be reflections of Him to the rest of the world. That means we should too. This spans to all of God's creation. * English Teachers * Bad volleyball players, Cocky volleyball players * Movie theater janitors * Homeless people * Stupid rich people * Siblings * Parents * yourself * Knowing your worth and being prideful is a fine line unless you have the right source of identity. * If your identity is founded in your Creator you will know the lengths He went to reach you and that is where your self-esteem should come from.","title":"1.

(Why not a general or builder or farmer?) - A shepherd knows his sheep, by name. - Sheep know their shepherd by his voice. - The shepherd's goal is the safety and well-being of the herd. - A shepherd was also a common analogy for a king - which is quite different form how we think of important people today. - Q: How many of you have seen an important leader like a CEO or President? - In this analogy, the king knows his people personally and his goal is to protect them, not gain power or money. The relationship pictured here is much more intimate. Q: What does it mean to \"climb up some other way?\" (verse 1) - we have this image of a \"gate\" or proper way of entry, so what does it mean to come into the sheep the wrong way? - A: The intention. The gate is for the shepherd who cares for the sheep, but thieves are there for personal gain. You can determine which one you are by what you think about while you're at church - is it the people and how you can connect with them or is it how you can put yourself on a good volleyball team or feel good about yourself by talking about other people behind their back? - We have no sheep to steal at FSBC, but we have youth and newcomers who can tell if someone is genuine and cares about them or if they're just here to have fun, eat free food, gossip, and play volleyball. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. (ESV) - John 10:4 Here we see that the shepherd doesn't use a stick or a border collie to get the sheep to obey him. The herd understands that the shepherd has their best interest in mind and will follow him wherever he leads. Summary of 1 - 6 - Jesus is the shepherd - He knows his sheep individually - His intention is to keep the sheep safe and care for them - The sheep respond to his voice - He does not drive his sheep but leads them - and they follow him I am the door verses 7 - 15 \"I am the door of the sheep\" I thought Jesus was the shepherd, what's this now? Also, why does He compare Himself to a door? This is still the same analogy - the shepherd was the door. He would lay down across the entrance to the sheep pen at night to keep the sheep in and predators out. His life is on the line for the sake of his sheep. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. (ESV) - John 10:10 Q: Who is the thief? Anyone who's purpose is selfish and not for the benefit of God's people - or all people. Q: What is the thief trying to steal, kill, and destroy? Some may say the thief is only trying to help the sheep have a good time while the shepherd has them locked up in the pen. Q: What does it mean to have \"life abundantly\"? - Abundant life isn\u2019t an especially long life. - Abundant life isn\u2019t an easy, comfortable life. - Abundant life is a life of satisfaction and contentment in Jesus. \u201cLife is a matter of degrees. Some have life, but it flickers like a dying candle, and is indistinct as the fire in the smoking flax; others are full of life, and are bright and vehement.\u201d (Spurgeon) From this comes the question: Is your life abundant, and if not, what is missing? Like verse 14 says, \"I know my own and my own know me\" Jesus wants you to trust Him, and He proved long ago that He doesn't care about the mistakes that you've made. Jesus wants to give you life, and life abundant, but you have to trust Him as the shepherd and decide if He is your leader or if you're still down to get stolen from the flock and eaten by thieves or wolves. Session 2 verses 16 - 42 The other Sheep verses 16 - 21 Who are the sheep that are not of Jesus' fold? verse 16 - 18 A: Gentiles, Jews are the original people of God, but Jesus is here to claim all of us. - That means it is Jesus that unites us, He is our leader. Not culture or language, hobbies or careers, but our shepherd. \"Therefore my Father loves Me\" - what does God value based on this statement? A: Self sacrifice for the good of others. - God is love, and love is caring and wishing the best for others. - We do not choose whether we should die or not, we are not immortal. But Jesus chose to give up His life for us. Jesus is a madman or the Son of God verses 19 - 21 The people are split, and there really are only two options: 1. Jesus is crazy. 2. Jesus is everything He says he is. \"I and the Father are One\" verses 22 - 30 Context At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. John 10:22 Also known as Hanukkah, the Feast of Dedication celebrated the cleansing and re-dedication of the temple after three years of desecration by Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria. Antiochus had attacked Jerusalem, stolen from the temple, killed thousands of Jews and outlawed Jewish practices. The Maccabees were a family that led a revolt against the king and used guerrilla warfare to take on the better equipped Syrians. They were able to recapture Jerusalem and take back the temple. This is important because a lot of people expected Jesus to be like Judah the Maccabee. Who are you? The pharisees find Jesus as he was walking, and encircle Him to finally get a straight answer. Q: What does it seem like the goal of the Pharisees is here? To get some political answer and pit Jesus against the Roman government. Q: Has Jesus been clear about who he is up to this point? I am the one who came from heaven (John 3:13, 6:38). Whoever believes on Me has eternal life (John 3:15). I am the unique Son of God (John 5:19-23). I will judge all humanity (John 5:19-23). all should honor Me just as the honor God the Father (John 5:19-23). the Hebrew Scriptures all speak of Me (John 5:39). I perfectly reveal God the Father (John 7:28-29). I always please God and never sin (John 8:29, 8:46). I am uniquely sent from God (John 8:42). before Abraham was, I Am (John 8:58). I am the Son of Man, prophesied by Daniel (John 9:37). I will raise Myself from the dead (John 10:17-18). I am the Bread of Life (John 6:48). I am the Light of the World (John 8:12). I am the Door (John 10:9). I am the Good Shepherd (John 10:11). Q: What is Jesus' reasoning for why they don't believe in Him? You are not my sheep. You do not follow me. Q: So what does it mean to be Jesus' sheep, practically? Being aware of how you impact other people. Do the things I say make people feel better or worse? When I'm done interacting with a person or group, how do they feel about me? Do they trust me? Validating your actions against what God would want from you, not what you want of yourself. My Sheep - have eternal life. - will never perish. - no one will take them from my hand. Jesus cares for those who seek him and desire His leadership. If you want Jesus to lead you, He will never let you down. Stones against Him \"For which of my good works are you going to stone me?\" \"Not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.\" Is it not written in your Law, \"I said, you are gods?\" (Psalm 82, Exodus 21:6, Exodus 22:8-9) This is not just a \"Destroyed with Facts and Logic\" response, but calls out an idea from the Old Testament that God and Man are meant to be intertwined and connected. The Old Testament judges were the people who God shared His word with, now the word is here, in the flesh. Jesus holds no hostility against them, instead He once more encourages to try to understand Him and judge Him based on his actions. Across the Jordan Jesus leaves Jerusalem to lower his wanted level. John did no miracles, but everything he said of Jesus was true. We should be like John and point people in the direction of Jesus.

Chief priests and Pharisees want to arrest Jesus, they are done asking questions Jesus left to Ephraim at the end of Ch 11 Now the Passover is almost here and people are wondering if Jesus will show up As we jump in, Jesus is back in Bethany where he raised Lazarus Mary Anoints Jesus read verses 1 - 5 Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. - John 12:3 Why is Mary washing Jesus' feet? Context When a guest entered the home, usually the guest\u2019s feet were washed with water and the guest\u2019s head was anointed with a dab of oil or perfume. They were coming in with dusty sandals and likely sweat on their brow from being in the hot sun. This was to refresh the guest and help them be more presentable. To attend to the feet was the task of the most lowly slave. Mary shows great humility and devotion. In her actions, Mary shows that she believes her expensive ointment is good enough only for the feet of Jesus, not even His head. Not only that, but women in ancient Israel rarely let down their hair - it was a mark of loose morals. But here she does not stop to think of what the public reaction would be; her only goal is to give everything she can to Jesus while He is still with them. What makes Judas comment? Who's is the ointment? Mary's Who is being anointed? Jesus So how does Judas fit in the picture? He breaks the awkward silence after Mary's gesture He doesn't.

Judas is selfish and a thief, but Jesus is the Son of God - so why doesn't he side with Judas here? Couldn't more people have been helped if the money was used to help the poor? \"For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.\" Mary knew on some level that Jesus would not be with them for much longer (she is preparing him for burial) so she is doing whatever she can while He is still here to honor him.

We are close to the end of this journey. The Triumphal Entry read verses 12 -19 Who are the main characters? - Jesus - Pharisees - Disciples & close friends - The crowd Why is it called the Triumphal entry? Triumphal: made, carried out, or used in celebration of a great victory or achievement. Because this was the time of the Passover, Jerusalem would already be filled with visitors coming to celebrate the feast. They celebrate the coming king that they hope will free them or at least feed them. Palm branches have been used since the time of the Macabees as a national symbol. The world has gone after him The Pharisees feel like they\u2019re losing the fight of popularity. But just like the crowd, they don\u2019t truly understand what Jesus is bringing and what it means to \u201cgo after him\u201d Who do you relate to out of this cast of characters? Most of us don\u2019t connect with the Pharisees - we are not against Jesus and don\u2019t think he\u2019s here to ruin everything. We are the crowd - happy to praise Jesus when we think he\u2019s on our side but unwilling to step in when Jesus is wrongfully beaten and crucified. Closing question: Do you understand who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him? When He commands you to love your neighbor, do you do that when you need new friends or when your neighbor costs you the volleyball game? When the Bible commands you to not slander (gossip) do you find a way to justify talking about others or are you the one to stand up for those who are being whispered about? Do you care for those on the fringes of friend groups or do you judge others while making the same mistakes they do?

What happens to unfruitful branches? What happens to fruitful ones? Context Where is Jesus? They are all still in the same room they had dinner in. It's probably getting late. What time of year is it? Passover is celebrated in the beginning of April What has Jesus been talking about? \"I have said these things to keep you from falling away.\" The world against you John 16:1-4 The disciples will not have an easy life. While Jesus was with his disciples, he was the sponge that soaked up the hatred of the world, now that his ministry is ending, his disciples will have to carry on and carry that weight themselves. Does anyone remember Travis's first joke during conference? About 2 guys on a bridge. One guy finds that the other was thinking of jumping off and tries to talk him out of it. They find out that they're both Christians but slightly different denominations so the one guy just pushes the other off the bridge. Most of history is not too far off from that. Religions have been fighting each other since the beginning, and a lot of the time the fighting even happens within one religion between people that understand it differently. That's actually one of the most common reasons that new Slavic churches pop up in Charlotte. In the time of the disciples, it wouldn't be long until they were hunted - one of these persecutors was Saul who repented and ended up writing the majority of the new Testament. But before he came to truly know God, he was an enemy of God without even realizing it. What's your favorite villain from pop culture? I like Magneto - he is a mutant and survivor of the holocaust fighting for the rights of mutants and equality between all people. But often times he takes things too far and people die in the name of justice. The villain thinks their acts are justified. The villain does what needs to be done for the ultimate good - the definition of good being whatever they decide. For your good John 16:5-15 Jesus again tells them that he must leave, but it's for the ultimate good of the disciples. Why couldn't he just stay forever? He is God, and he's already proven that death has no hold over Him, so why did he have to leave in the first place? It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will no come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. - John 16:7 Why is the Holy Spirit better than Jesus just staying here? Jesus can only be in one place at a time. The Holy Spirit is everywhere at once. The disciples have their crutch removed and must now stand on their own faith that they've developed over their time with Jesus. Did it work? The disciples went on to carry Christianity to the known world and were able to preserve the words and actions for use to be able to read them. They lived and died for what they learned from Jesus. What does the Spirit do according to Jesus? John 16:8-11 Convict of sin Because they do not believe in me Sin is a lack of faith in God's plan. With the Holy Spirit, you will be able to see better when you are missing the mark. Things that are normal by the world's standard will be out of the question for you because you can see where they lead. What sins do you think the Devil uses most for your generation? What are the cracks that he's found in the wall to slip through? Things like laziness, slander, and apathy will set off alarms and you will know when you are straying from God's plan. Convict of righteousness Because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer We see Jesus as righteous. But the majority of people in his time saw him as a rebel and imposter. What does righteousness look like in our culture? Have you ever watched someone act or speak and think to yourself, \"That's what a Christian should act like?\" What the world considers to be righteous and what Jesus consider righteous are quite different. We are told to let God handle vengeance, and our job is to love people. Our righteousness is shown through our humility and love, not through having power over others or being better by comparison. Righteousness does not come from money or status, but from how you treat others. Convict of judgement Because the ruler of this world is judged The Devil is awaiting judgement as is everyone who does not know Jesus. As Christians, we know that we are on the winning side, and it's our duty to love those around us enough to save them from this judgement. Strengthen each other for the journey and make disciples of the loners and outcasts in your classes and workplaces. Jesus did not care about ethnicity, politics, or social status. He only cared about the well-being of the people around him and the status of their soul. Part 1 Conclusion The world is against us. The lies we are told to divide us are intended to disrupt unity and love. Jesus has always had a plan, and is still with us to help us on our journey. Connection with the Holy Spirit will lead us on the right path. Part 2 verses 16 - 33 Part 1 Recap The world against you: don\u2019t let a good get in the way of great. Tradition is good. Volleyball is good, fellowship is good, having close friends is good. Conviction: reflect often. Recalibrate yourself if you feel empty - connect with Jesus and see what you need to adjust. Sorrow into Joy verse 16 - 24 Do you see me? verses 16 - 18 \"Jesus, we do not understand\" The disciples are confused - Jesus has not yet instituted a new kingdom on Earth as it was prophesied. If He is still to make it happen why is he going away? And if that was never His intent then why did he come in the first place? i-see-you.gif ![[avatar-movie-i-see-you.gif]] A little while, and you will not see me \"See me\" - the\u014dre\u014d Discern who I am. The disciples will become discouraged and scattered because it will seem like Jesus and his mission are gone. And again a little while, and you will see me Jesus will come back, and they will again see and understand. Better this time. Birthing pains verses 19 - 22 \"You will be sorrowful\" - Jesus knows that hard times are coming. Does he have the power to stop them? Question: If Jesus could stop all this pain, for himself and His disciples, why didn't he? Do you not realize that I could call on my Father, and at once he would provide me with more than twelve legions of angels ? - Matthew 26:53 Jesus could have avoided their sadness and his own pain. But as the cliche goes - no pain, no gain . And in the next few chapters we will see that the biggest gains require the most pain. So is pain necessary? If so, why? \"The crucible for silver and the furnace for hold, but the Lord test the heart\". - Proverbs 17:3 Difficulties show us who we really are and how much we care about other people. Jesus is not here to help you avoid difficult times, His mission it to make you know how to navigate them in confidence and come out stronger than before.

Does anyone remember Travis's first joke during conference? About 2 guys on a bridge. One guy finds that the other was thinking of jumping off and tries to talk him out of it. They find out that they're both Christians but slightly different denominations so the one guy just pushes the other off the bridge. Most of history is not too far off from that. Religions have been fighting each other since the beginning, and a lot of the time the fighting even happens within one religion between people that understand it differently. That's actually one of the most common reasons that new Slavic churches pop up in Charlotte. In the time of the disciples, it wouldn't be long until they were hunted - one of these persecutors was Saul who repented and ended up writing the majority of the new Testament. But before he came to truly know God, he was an enemy of God without even realizing it. What's your favorite villain from pop culture? I like Magneto - he is a mutant and survivor of the holocaust fighting for the rights of mutants and equality between all people. But often times he takes things too far and people die in the name of justice. The villain thinks their acts are justified.

The Pharisees were growing angry with Jesus making disciples A: He was avoiding a confrontation with the Pharisees, He knew it was not time yet Q: Why did Jesus choose to travel through Samaria? Samaritans were half-breed Israelites. During the Assyrian rule, all but the lowest class Israelites were exiled from Samaria. Those left blended their families and culture with Gentiles of the region. A: Jesus wasn't racist. He came to save the broken, Samaritans were the target audience. They come to Jacob's well The well offers a a chance to rest, even though it was only the 6th hour of the day (noon). This is relatable to us, we have all felt tired and hot and in need of cold water. Q: Why do you think Jesus stayed outside the city? Because He didn't want to deal with Samaritans? Why not just go and do a miracle in the market? They would all believe probably. Too tired? He knew the woman was coming Read verses 7-15 Jesus meets the Samaritan woman Typically, even to this day, women travel together, yet she is here alone, in the heat of the day, to draw water. Q: Why was she here now, and why was she alone? Even among Samaritans, she is on the fringes of society Q: Why would Jesus want to talk to her? The fact that she's alone and coming at a weird time are red flags the woman is questioning his actions risk gossip, impurity, temptation Jesus doesn't care about your nationality, your mistakes, your place in society. He is here to bring heaven to earth and that means breaking down cultural boundaries that are meant to put some people above others. Jesus and the woman talk about water \"Living Water\" could also refer to moving water, water that has less bacteria because it is not stagnant Jesus: \"If you knew who I was, you'd be asking me for water\" He is making her curious about who he is and what he has to offer If you knew Jesus better, you would want more what he has to offer \"Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d John 4:14 Q: What does he mean by \"a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life\"? A: you will be able to provide for others yourself \"What if I feel like my spring has dried up? I used to have it but I don't feel the same anymore\" - Drink again, go to the source, reconnect Food for thought Are we aware of our brokenness and searching for healing? How do we decide who is worthy of our love? Do we exclude people in our lives because of the mistakes that they've made? Action Take a minute to note who in your life seems like the Samaritan Woman. Give them a nickname if you're afraid of people peeking at your notes. Pray for them this week, and talk to them if you're not a chicken If you feel like you don't have the spring of living water that Jesus is talking about, write down why you think that is and what you could do to fix it. If you think you already have the living water, write down what you've been doing with it and who you've been giving it to. Part II (verses 18-54) Quick Recap: - Jesus was traveling through Samaria and met a woman at a well - He didn't care that she was a Samaritan, a woman, or that she was alone - Jesus looks past our mistakes and misfortunes, and we should do the same - Jesus offers living water that will bubble up form us if we have a strong relationship with Him Read verses: 16-26 \"I who speak to you am He\" They have been talking for a little bit and it would be more proper if her husband was present. Jesus said to her, \u201cGo, call your husband, and come here.\u201d The woman answered him, \u201cI have no husband.\u201d \u201cYou are right in saying, \u2018I have no husband\u2019; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.\u201d - John 4:16-18 Seems a little savage to call someone out like that - YOu ARE RIGht In sAyinG \"i hAVE no hUsBand\" - like you're poking fun at their failures. Q: Why would Jesus do that? - A: Jesus' goal here is not just to jeer at the woman, he wants her to confront her past. In order to to obtain living water, the junk blocking your spring must be cleaned out. Q: Were her failed marriages her fault? - A: we don't know, and it doesn't matter - We have a tendency to avoid 'damaged' people even if we don't know the full story Q: Why does the woman respond with a question about worship? \"Sir, I perceive you are prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.\" - When you bring home a speeding ticket and your parents ask how your day was, would you rather bring up your ticket or literally anything else? - Like the chisel skit, it's scary to let someone else chip away parts of you, but in the end it is better. - A: to avoid the question, to skirt confronting her mistakes Jesus rolls with it, and tells her that soon it won't matter and no one will debate where worship should happen. He also reveals who he is , he didn't do that for anyone else. Not at the wedding, not to the Pharisees, but to this woman who is not accepted by anyone. Why? Because she is ready for His kingdom Read verses 27-38 The fields are white for harvest I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.\u201d - John 4:38 Group Q : with those around you, come up with 5 names of people who sowed the field before you came into the picture. - John the Baptist - Moses - King David - D. Pasha - Chris Tomlin We are a small part of a much bigger story, nonetheless, we must decide what side of the story we want to be on. Read verses 39-45 The Samaritans believe The woman herself became a sower that went before the disciples - The Samaritans came to believe because of what they themselves had seen, not because of what the woman had told them - Just so, our faith must depend on our own experience with Jesus and not just what we hear from other people. Several weeks ago I was asked at Cafe about when my faith became my own, I shared my testimony about how I came to believe in Jesus based on my own experience instead of the experiences of my family and friends. Group Q: One or two people from your group, share about when your faith became your own instead of someone else's. Your faith will grow to stand on its own, no matter what you do. Where you put your faith depends on you. It could be in knowledge, wealth, relationships, etc. But when your life is over it won't be those things that determine your eternity. Will you be ready to meet Jesus on another level or is thinking about that time something you avoid?","title":"John Chapter 4"},{"location":"Studies/John/John%20Chapter%204/#john-bible_study","text":"Samaritan woman at Jacob's well","title":"john #bible_study"},{"location":"Studies/John/John%20Chapter%204/#part-i-verses-1-17","text":"Main points - Jesus did not come to save just Israel, but the broken and ostracized - If we know Jesus, we have the spring of living water Read Verses 1-6","title":"Part I (verses 1-17)"},{"location":"Studies/John/John%20Chapter%204/#jesus-travels-through-samaria","text":"Q: Why did Jesus have to travel in the first place?

Q: Why would Jesus do that? - A: Jesus' goal here is not just to jeer at the woman, he wants her to confront her past. In order to to obtain living water, the junk blocking your spring must be cleaned out. Q: Were her failed marriages her fault? - A: we don't know, and it doesn't matter - We have a tendency to avoid 'damaged' people even if we don't know the full story Q: Why does the woman respond with a question about worship? \"Sir, I perceive you are prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.\" - When you bring home a speeding ticket and your parents ask how your day was, would you rather bring up your ticket or literally anything else? - Like the chisel skit, it's scary to let someone else chip away parts of you, but in the end it is better. - A: to avoid the question, to skirt confronting her mistakes Jesus rolls with it, and tells her that soon it won't matter and no one will debate where worship should happen. He also reveals who he is , he didn't do that for anyone else. Not at the wedding, not to the Pharisees, but to this woman who is not accepted by anyone. Why?

Q: Why were the Pharisees so upset at what seemed like a good thing? A: It goes deeper than \"it's against the Sabbath.\" This is their way of life put into question. What is the worst genre of music? What if Jesus came back, today, just to tell us that Country is the genre of worship that is his favorite and henceforth all of our songs should be country?

The goal is to make heaven on earth, the details only matter if it's to help those who don't yet know God relate to Him better. Language, clothing, money, education, it's only good if it brings glory to God. John 5:17 Q: Why does Jesus reply with \"My Father is working until now, and I am working\" - what does work have to do with healing someone? A: Jesus was 'working' on the Sabbath and told the newly healed man to 'work' by taking up his bed and walking. Jesus says \"My Father is working until now\" - God the Father works even until the Sabbath. he is a working God - not just someone who commands and oversees, but steps in Himself. The Sabbath was ordained for man's benefit, not because God needed rest. John 5:18 This is the first time that John mentions the Pharisees wanting to kill Jesus, because he broke the Sabbath and told other to do it too, and because he claimed to be the Son of God. Jesus defends his mission John 5:19-29 Jesus now goes into a monologue defending his actions and explaining his purpose here on Earth Jesus bring this up as a comparison to how God interacted with Israel up until now. Q: Before Jesus, how did God speak to His people? A: Through prophets. They would hear from God and pass His laws, desires, and command to Israel. But now, Jesus take the place of the Prophet. We no longer have someone between us and God, because Jesus is God. Q: John 5:25 What is Jesus talking about when he says the 'dead will hear the voice of the Son of God?' A: Not literally dead, but spiritually. In verses 24 and 25, Jesus firmly claims to be the key to eternal life. This man that looked and spoke and smelled like any other man claimed to be one with God. small group Q: John 5:29 says the dead will have resurrection and 'those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.' Does this mean that salvation is based on the good works we've done? If not, what is Jesus saying? A: Your works are an indicator of your faith, by your works we can tell what kind of person you are. It's not about your career, but how you treat the people around you and the amount of respect you have for God and His word. John 5:30-47 The scene is explained as if there is a court trial going on, Jesus claimed to be the judge of men and is now defending that claim. Jesus knows the Law, He is referencing Deuteronomy 19:15: \u201cA single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed. Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established. small group Q: Who are the 5 pieces of evidence Jesus mentions?

Jonah is given a message from God directly. Nineveh is a great and evil city. Jonah doesn't want to go there and goes directly against God's instructions Main character: Jonah Knows God but goes against His plan anyway Can we blame him? Nineveh must have been pretty bad. Conflict: going to Nineveh City of sinners God wishes to give them one last chance in the form of Jonah Was is like Las Vegas? We have a clear direction for this story in the first 4 verses of the book. Jonah 1:4-6 The sea becomes very stormy. Jonah is sleeping through it. Mirrors Matthew 8:23-27 Discuss the similarities and differences of these 2 passages * Jonah's storm is because of his disobedience, and is an attempt from God to turn Jonah around. * Jesus' storm was meant to bolster the faith of the disciples. * Jonah slept in an attempt to block God out, ride out the storm. * Jesus could sleep because he had complete faith in God. Example: * It's 3 am. You're in a tent. It's raining. There's water dripping right next to you. You try to sleep and wait for morning to take care of it. Jonah 1:9-10 The sailors wake Jonah and ask him about himself.

Jonah knows who made the sea and the dry land and yet, here he is. It's easy to poke fun of Jonah for this nonsense answer, but we do the same thing. How often do we recite cookie cutter theological answers and rattle off prayers like we're trained to do? Jonah knew these answers, but regurgitated them as if for a test. His actions prove that what he says and what he does are different, to say the least. Jonah 1:11-12 Jonah asks to be thrown into the sea and the sailors eventually comply. Discuss : Was this a good solution? 'Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you.' Jonah's solution is to die. Not prayer, not compliance with God's will, he just wants to quit. Jonah is stubborn enough to die rather than just stop for a second and reflect. He knows of God's mercy, it's the reason he was sent to Nineveh in the first place. But his pride and stubbornness blind him. Jonah 1:13-17 Focus: Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. Discuss: Here, the pagan sailors who do not know God show more compassion and grace towards Jonah than he did towards Nineveh. Only when they can see no other options do they do what Jonah asks. It is the sailors who pray to God, not the Prophet. The sailors are more humble and can see that there is no point in going against God's will. Jonah gets his wish of being thrown overboard, but God is not done with him yet. Despite Jonah's best efforts to run, God sticks with him to fulfill his plan. Sometimes, unbelievers show more godliness than those who have about known God since they knew their right from their left. It's not about what you know about God, it's about what you do with it. If your actions show less love and respect for the world around you than an atheist, what kind of God are you serving? And why would anyone want to serve a God like that if His representatives act disrespectfully? Despite Jonah's mistakes and despite the evil of Nineveh, God keeps giving out more chances for people to find Him. God wants our company and he loves us enough to look past our innumerous mistakes to have a chance at being connected to us. God loves you, and if you have not experienced that for yourself, don't wait for a fish to swallow you.","title":"Jonah Chapter 1"},{"location":"Studies/Jonah/Jonah%20Chapter%201/#jonah-bible_study","text":"Intro questions: 1.
